# Bengals go all-in with historic offensive investments

The Cincinnati Bengals committed over $570 million to their offensive core during the 2025 offseason, securing Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins through at least 2028 while overhauling their defensive coaching staff after missing the playoffs. Despite fielding the NFL's top passing offense in 2024, the franchise's most aggressive financial commitment in team history came alongside mixed free agency results, a poorly-reviewed draft class, and significant organizational changes that reflect both championship urgency and long-term roster management challenges.

The Bengals' approach represents a dramatic philosophical shift from their historically conservative spending patterns. By making Chase the **highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at $40.25 million annually** and extending Higgins on a team-friendly $28.75 million per year deal, Cincinnati has created the most expensive wide receiver tandem in league history at a combined $69 million AAV. This investment, coupled with Burrow's existing $275 million contract, signals an unmistakable all-in mentality for their championship window that contrasts sharply with their modest external free agency additions and developmental draft approach.

## Historic receiver contracts reshape franchise priorities

The Bengals' offseason centerpiece was undoubtedly the Ja'Marr Chase extension, a 4-year, $161 million deal that not only avoided a potential training camp holdout but established new market precedents for non-quarterbacks. Chase's **$112 million in guarantees**, including $73.8 million fully guaranteed at signing, reflects his status as the NFL's 2024 Triple Crown winner with 127 catches, 1,708 yards, and 17 touchdowns. The structure cleverly uses void years to manage immediate cap impact, resulting in a reasonable $23.57 million cap hit for 2025.

Perhaps more surprising was Tee Higgins' willingness to accept below-market guarantees to remain in Cincinnati. His 4-year, $115 million extension includes just **$30 million fully guaranteed at signing**, significantly less than comparable receivers like Calvin Ridley ($50 million guaranteed) or Mike Evans ($52 million). The deal essentially becomes a series of team options after 2026, providing the Bengals crucial flexibility while keeping their elite passing attack intact. Higgins explicitly stated he took less to play alongside Burrow and Chase, prioritizing championship potential over maximizing earnings.

The financial commitment extends beyond the receivers. Mike Gesicki's 3-year extension ensures continuity at tight end after his 65-catch season, the second-most by a Bengals tight end in 43 years. Combined with B.J. Hill's 3-year, $33 million defensive tackle extension, the Bengals have locked up their core performers while creating approximately **$46-51 million in effective cap space** through strategic cuts and the NFL's increased $279.5 million salary cap.

## Defensive overhaul follows disappointing season

Following a defensive collapse that ranked 25th in the NFL and cost them a playoff berth, the Bengals made their most significant coaching changes of the Zac Taylor era. The January 6 firing of defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo after six seasons, along with position coaches Frank Pollack (offensive line), Marion Hobby (defensive line), and James Bettcher (linebackers), represented a clear acknowledgment that schematic changes were necessary.

Al Golden's hiring as the new defensive coordinator brings both familiarity and fresh perspective. Having previously served as the Bengals' linebackers coach from 2020-2021, Golden returns from Notre Dame with championship game experience and a philosophy emphasizing flexibility over rigid schemes. His "malleable" approach promises multiple defensive looks specifically designed to counter the AFC North's strong rushing attacks - a critical need after the Ravens, Browns, and Steelers all ranked in the top 13 in rushing offense.

The defensive staff additions include **Sean Desai as senior defensive assistant**, bringing recent NFL coordinator experience from Philadelphia and the Rams, and Jerry Montgomery as defensive line coach after nine successful years in Green Bay. These hires suggest a blend of proven NFL experience with Golden's college innovation, though the immediate challenge remains substantial given the unit's 2024 struggles.

## Mixed free agency results expose resource limitations

Despite their aggressive approach to retaining internal talent, the Bengals' external free agency additions were notably modest, reflecting either budgetary constraints from the massive receiver extensions or confidence in internal development. The most significant signing was defensive tackle **T.J. Slaton on a 2-year, $15.1 million deal** from Green Bay, addressing their 31st-ranked run defense with a player who ranked third in run stop win rate.

The offensive line received minimal attention despite losing starting right guard Alex Cappa to Las Vegas. Lucas Patrick's 1-year, $2.1 million signing represents a stopgap solution rather than a significant upgrade, raising concerns about protection for their franchise quarterback. The reunion with running back Samaje Perine (2-year, $3.8 million) adds veteran depth and elite pass protection but doesn't address the need for a dynamic rushing threat.

Notable departures include the retirement of team captain Sam Hubbard after seven seasons, creating a **$9.51 million cap savings** but leaving a leadership void, and linebacker Akeem Davis-Gaither's departure to Arizona on a 2-year, $11 million deal. The loss of Davis-Gaither particularly stings given his special teams contributions and the linebacker depth concerns that plagued the 2024 defense.

## Draft strategy prioritizes development over immediate impact

The Bengals' 2025 draft class received **universally poor reviews**, ranking dead last among all 32 teams with a 2.06 GPA average across 24 major outlets. The selection of Texas A&M edge rusher Shemar Stewart with the 17th overall pick exemplified their high-risk, high-reward approach. Despite recording just 4.5 sacks in three college seasons, Stewart's exceptional athleticism and 6'5", 267-pound frame represent a developmental bet that drew criticism for a team in win-now mode.

The draft's brightest spot came in round three with Georgia guard **Dylan Fairchild**, whose 87.0 PFF pass-blocking grade and one allowed sack in his entire college career suggest immediate starting potential at left guard. The selection addresses a critical need while reuniting Fairchild with 2024 first-round pick Amarius Mims, potentially forming a young, talented interior for years to come.

Linebacker depth was addressed through South Carolina's Demetrius Knight Jr. (2nd round) and Clemson's Barrett Carter (4th round), both fitting Golden's flexible defensive approach. However, the 25-year-old Knight's age and Stewart's limited production reinforce concerns about immediate impact. The draft's later rounds added offensive line versatility through Miami's Jalen Rivers and running back depth with Texas Tech's Tahj Brooks, but the overall class lacks the proven playmakers expected for a championship contender.

## Hendrickson standoff threatens defensive stability

The most significant unresolved issue involves All-Pro defensive end Trey Hendrickson, whose contract dispute casts a shadow over the defense's potential improvement. After leading the NFL with **17.5 sacks in 2024**, Hendrickson has stated he won't play under his current $15.8 million salary, seeking a market-rate extension in the $28-30 million range following recent deals for Myles Garrett ($40 million AAV) and Danielle Hunter ($35.6 million AAV).

The Bengals reportedly offered $28 million annually but haven't reached an agreement, granting Hendrickson permission to seek a trade while simultaneously drafting Stewart as potential insurance. The situation presents a critical decision point: paying premium prices for a 30-year-old pass rusher or risking defensive regression by trading their best defensive player. With mandatory minicamp approaching and potential fines looming, resolution becomes increasingly urgent for a defense that can't afford to lose its most productive player.

## Salary cap gymnastics enable aggressive approach

The Bengals' ability to execute their expensive offseason plan required creative cap management and strategic decisions. Starting with approximately $27 million in cap space, they created additional room through the retirements and releases of Hubbard, Rankins, and Cappa, generating roughly **$27 million in savings**. The current effective cap space of $46-51 million provides flexibility for additional moves, though much depends on the Hendrickson situation.

Burrow's $46 million cap hit for 2025 represents a significant jump from $29.6 million in 2024, but the quarterback has publicly stated willingness to restructure his deal to help retain teammates. A potential restructure could create up to **$19.3 million in additional space**, though the Bengals have historically been conservative about pushing money into future years. Currently carrying over $40 million in void years (moderate compared to Philadelphia's $390 million), they've maintained more flexibility than teams utilizing extreme cap manipulation.

## Championship window demands immediate defensive improvement

The Bengals' 2025 offseason represents a fascinating dichotomy between aggressive financial commitments and conservative roster building. While securing their offensive core through unprecedented investments, the limited external additions and developmental draft approach suggest either supreme confidence in internal improvement or concerning resource limitations. The success of Golden's defensive transformation becomes paramount, as the offense has already proven capable of elite production.

The AFC North presents both opportunity and challenge. Baltimore enters as division favorites despite an aging core, Pittsburgh faces quarterback uncertainty even with Aaron Rodgers speculation, and Cleveland's quarterback room chaos creates instability. Yet the Bengals' 25th-ranked defense must dramatically improve to capitalize on these divisional vulnerabilities, particularly against the run-heavy approaches of their rivals.

**The ultimate measure of this offseason will be whether the Bengals' historic financial commitment to three players translates into playoff success**. With Burrow entering his prime at 28 and the receiver contracts structured for a 3-4 year window, the franchise has explicitly chosen quality over quantity. The gamble that internal development, coaching changes, and selective additions can overcome the departure of key veterans while maximizing their offensive investment will define not just 2025, but potentially the entire Burrow era in Cincinnati. The margin for error has narrowed considerably, but the ceiling - with the NFL's most explosive passing attack intact - remains championship caliber.
