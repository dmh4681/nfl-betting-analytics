# Panthers 2025: Aggressive defensive rebuild transforms roster

The Carolina Panthers invested over $126 million in defensive free agents while selecting WR Tetairoa McMillan 8th overall, signaling a dual commitment to fixing the NFL's worst 2024 defense and supporting third-year quarterback Bryce Young. GM Dan Morgan's first full offseason featured **six defensive signings**, strategic cap management through veteran releases, and eight draft picks focused on youth development. The organization maintained complete coaching continuity under Dave Canales for the first time since 2019, establishing organizational stability after years of turnover.

## Free agency brings defensive transformation

The Panthers' free agency approach centered on reconstructing a defense that allowed an NFL-record 534 points in 2024. **Tershawn Wharton** (3-year, $54 million from Kansas City) and **Tre'von Moehrig** (3-year, $51 million from Las Vegas) headlined the defensive overhaul, bringing youth and proven production to critical positions. Carolina added **Bobby Brown III** (3-year, $21 million), **Patrick Jones II** (2-year, $20 million), and veterans Christian Rozeboom and Sam Martin to complete the defensive rebuild.

Offensively, the Panthers made minimal external additions, signing only **Rico Dowdle** (1-year, up to $6.25 million) to replace the released Miles Sanders at running back. The Asheville native rushed for 1,079 yards with Dallas in 2024, becoming the Cowboys' first undrafted 1,000-yard rusher. Carolina's offensive restraint reflected confidence in their existing core and a strategic decision to allocate resources toward defensive improvements.

## Key departures reshape salary cap structure

Carolina's aggressive roster restructuring included releasing **Miles Sanders** (saving $5.225 million) and **Jadeveon Clowney** (saving $7.78 million) to create cap flexibility. The team lost starting safety **Xavier Woods** to Tennessee after he played all 1,218 defensive snaps in 2024 - the most in the NFL. Veteran punter **Johnny Hekker** also departed for Tennessee, while depth pieces like Jordan Fuller (Atlanta) and Ian Thomas (Las Vegas) found new homes.

The Panthers allowed franchise legend **Shaq Thompson** to enter free agency after 13 seasons, ending an era while creating $4.2 million in dead money. These calculated departures reflected Morgan's willingness to move on from aging veterans and underperforming contracts, prioritizing long-term cap health over short-term continuity. The moves left Carolina with just $8.8 million in total dead money - their cleanest cap situation in years.

## Trade strategy maximizes draft capital

Carolina executed a calculated trade strategy that began during the 2024 season and extended through draft day. The **Diontae Johnson trade** (October 2024) netted a 5th-round pick from Baltimore, while the **Jonathan Mingo deal** (November 2024) brought a 4th-rounder from Dallas. These moves cleared underperforming receivers while stockpiling draft capital for the 2025 rebuild.

On draft day, Morgan aggressively traded up twice to secure edge rushers Nic Scourton (51st overall) and Princely Umanmielen (77th overall). The Panthers packaged multiple picks to Denver and New England, demonstrating their conviction in addressing pass rush needs after missing on edge rushers in round one. This aggressive approach contrasted with previous regimes' passive draft strategies.

## Draft builds around Bryce Young's development

The Panthers' eight-pick draft class reflected a clear organizational philosophy: surround Bryce Young with weapons while fixing the defense through volume. **Tetairoa McMillan** (6'4", 219 lbs) at 8th overall provides Young with an elite catch-radius receiver compared to Mike Evans. The selection drew mixed reactions - PFF graded it A+ while Mel Kiper gave it C+ - but aligned with Morgan's best-player-available approach.

Carolina then pivoted to defense, selecting edge rushers **Nic Scourton** (Texas A&M) and **Princely Umanmielen** (Ole Miss) in consecutive rounds. The double-dip strategy addressed their league-worst 32 sacks from 2024. Later selections included RB Trevor Etienne (Georgia), S Lathan Ransom (Ohio State), DT Cam Jackson (Florida), TE Mitchell Evans (Notre Dame), and WR Jimmy Horn Jr. (Colorado). **No quarterback was drafted**, signaling full commitment to Young's development entering his crucial third season.

## Internal retention prioritizes defensive cornerstone

The Panthers' most significant move involved extending **Jaycee Horn** to a 4-year, $100 million deal with $70 million guaranteed, making him the NFL's highest-paid defensive back. This franchise-altering commitment established Horn as the defensive cornerstone through 2029. Additional re-signings included **Andy Dalton** (2-year, $8 million) as Young's mentor, **Mike Jackson** (2-year, $14.5 million) after leading the team with 17 pass deflections, and key role players like Tommy Tremble, Austin Corbett, and Brady Christensen.

Carolina also retained return specialist **Raheem Blackshear**, who ranked second in the NFL with 791 gross return yards in 2024. The selective retention strategy balanced maintaining continuity in critical areas while allowing cap flexibility for external additions. Notably, the team avoided expensive veteran restructures, maintaining a clean cap sheet for future maneuverability.

## Coaching continuity marks organizational shift

For the first time since 2019, Carolina maintained complete coaching continuity with Dave Canales returning as head coach and Ejiro Evero retained as defensive coordinator despite the unit's historic struggles. The staff additions focused on the defensive side, with **Renaldo Hill** joining as secondary coach and **AC Carter** coaching outside linebackers. Carolina parted ways with safeties coach Bert Watts and outside linebackers coach Tem Lukabu after the defensive failures.

The front office structure solidified with **Brandt Tilis** serving his first full offseason as Executive Vice President of Football Operations alongside GM Dan Morgan. This partnership, modeled after successful front offices in San Francisco and Kansas City, brought modern cap management and analytics to an organization previously lacking in both areas. The stability represents a philosophical shift from the constant turnover of the David Tepper era.

## Context reveals methodical rebuild approach

Carolina enters 2025 with approximately **$18.7-21.6 million** in cap space, positioning them favorably within the NFC South where New Orleans faces a $52.3 million deficit. The team's **27 rookies** on the current roster represents an extraordinary youth movement, with **$104.6 million** in projected 2027 cap space providing future flexibility. Jonathon Brooks' second ACL tear (out for 2025) forced adjustments at running back, while the defense still lacks proven linebacker depth after Thompson's departure.

The Panthers addressed their three biggest weaknesses - pass rush, safety play, and run defense - through free agency and the draft. However, **linebacker remains a glaring hole** with only Josey Jewell and unproven youngsters like Trevin Wallace available. The offensive line maintained continuity with all five starters returning healthy, while the receiving corps transformed from weakness to strength with McMillan joining Legette, Thielen, and Coker.

Morgan's approach reflects a commitment to sustainable building rather than quick fixes. The minimal rollover from 2024 (just $500,000) represents a missed opportunity for a rebuilding team, but the clean cap sheet and youth movement position Carolina for a **2026-2027 competitive window** when their rookie contracts align with significant cap space. The 2025 season serves as a critical evaluation year for Young and the defensive rookies, with playoff contention remaining unlikely but meaningful progress expected.
