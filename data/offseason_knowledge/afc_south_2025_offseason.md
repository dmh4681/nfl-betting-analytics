- **Kenyon Green (RG)** - Traded to Philadelphia for C.J. Gardner-Johnson
- **Shaq Mason (RG)** - Released for cap savings

**Other Notable Departures:**

- **Round 2, Pick 48:** **Aireontae Ersery (OT, Minnesota)** - Left tackle prospect  
- **Round 3, Pick 79:** **Jaylin Noel (WR, Iowa State)** - Speed threat with 4.37 forty time
- **Rounds 4-7:** Focus on depth at cornerback, running back, and special teams

### 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions

**Historic Contracts:**
- **Derek Stingley Jr. (CB)** - 3-year, $90 million extension ($89M guaranteed), making him highest-paid DB in NFL history
- **Danielle Hunter (DE)** - 1-year, $35.6 million extension through 2026

**Other Retentions:**
- **Mario Edwards Jr. (DT)** - 2-year, $9.5 million deal

### 7. Context and Analysis

**Salary Cap Situation:**
- Entered offseason with limited cap space due to major contracts
- Created flexibility through Tunsil and Green trades
- Dead money manageable compared to other teams

**Critical Assessment:**
The Texans' offseason represents a calculated gamble that has drawn significant criticism. CBS Sports analyst Garrett Podell noted C.J. Stroud as one of the biggest losers in the NFL, claiming that the offensive line ended up taking a few steps back rather than forward. The decision to trade away Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil, who was arguably one of the best one-on-one pass protectors in the NFL, while replacing him with Cam Robinson, who allowed the third-highest pass pressure rate among left tackles with at least 500 pass blocking snaps (12.1%) and the fourth-most sacks (nine), has raised serious questions about protecting their franchise quarterback.

**Needs Successfully Addressed:**
- Added veteran receiver help through Kirk and draft picks
- Upgraded secondary with Stingley extension and Gardner-Johnson trade
- Created draft capital for future roster building

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Offensive line protection may have actually gotten worse
- Tank Dell's injury recovery timeline uncertain
- Lack of proven depth at multiple positions

## Indianapolis Colts: Anthony Richardson's Make-or-Break Season

The Indianapolis Colts' 2025 offseason reflected an organization under pressure to show immediate improvement around second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson. After missing the playoffs again, GM Chris Ballard acknowledged the need for more competition throughout the roster while retaining the coaching staff for continuity.

### 1. Free Agency Signings (External Acquisitions)

**Quarterback Competition:**
- **Daniel Jones (QB)** - 1-year, $14 million deal to compete with Anthony Richardson
- **Tim Boyle (QB)** - Veteran backup depth

**Defensive Overhaul:**
- **Charvarius Ward (CB)** - 3-year, $60 million deal, biggest CB commitment under Chris Ballard
- **Cam Bynum (S)** - 3-year contract worth up to $45 million ($15M AAV) 
- **Will Harris (S)** - Depth safety signing

**Depth Additions:**
- **Khalil Herbert (RB)** - Running back depth behind Jonathan Taylor
- **Jerome Britt (LB)** - Linebacker depth
- **Various depth signings** at multiple positions

### 2. Free Agency Losses (Key Departures)

**Cap Casualties:**
- **Ryan Kelly (C)** - Long-time center released for cap savings
- **E.J. Speed (LB)** - Starting linebacker departed
- **Julian Blackmon (S)** - Starting safety lost to free agency

**Other Departures:**
- Multiple depth players not retained as organization prioritized roster competition

### 3. Trades

The Colts were relatively quiet in the trade market, focusing primarily on free agency and the draft to address roster needs.

### 4. 2025 NFL Draft

**First Round Focus:**
- **Tyler Warren (TE, Penn State)** - Projected first-round pick to address tight end needs and provide Anthony Richardson a reliable target

**Additional Picks:**
- Focus on linebacker depth, cornerback development, and offensive line
- Emphasis on adding competition at multiple position groups

### 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions

**Core Retentions:**
- **DeForest Buckner (DT)** - Maintained as defensive anchor

- Practice squad players elevated

### 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes

**Stability Maintained:**
- **Shane Steichen** - Head coach retained despite playoff miss
- **Chris Ballard** - GM retained with organizational support
- **Lou Anarumo** - Hired as new defensive coordinator from Cincinnati

**Philosophy Shift:**
Ballard acknowledged being "emotional" about players and letting that "bleed into how I built the team," admitting he should have created more competition throughout the roster rather than re-signing their own free agents.

### 7. Context and Analysis

**Salary Cap Situation:**
- Approximately $31.4 million in projected cap space
- Flexibility to make additional moves if needed
- Dead money manageable compared to league average

**Anthony Richardson Development:**
Ballard identified Richardson's two main areas for improvement: "The No. 1 thing we have to figure out, and what Anthony's got to work through, is staying healthy" and "being consistent down after down, play after play".

**Critical Assessment:**
The Colts' offseason represents a measured approach to building around Richardson while acknowledging organizational mistakes. The Daniel Jones signing provides legitimate competition while the defensive investments through Ward and Bynum address critical secondary needs.

**Needs Successfully Addressed:**
- Added quarterback competition and depth
- Significantly upgraded secondary with proven veterans
- Created roster-wide competition Ballard identified as missing

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Anthony Richardson's health and consistency remain question marks
- Offensive line needs continued attention
- Tight end production must improve dramatically

### 1. Free Agency Signings (External Acquisitions)

- **Chidobe Awuzie (CB)** - Cornerback depth and experience

### 2. Free Agency Losses (Key Departures)

### 7. Context and Analysis

Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk was also among that group.

**Historical Context:**
The Week 18 loss secured the Titans the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft, their first time holding it since 2016.

**Critical Assessment:**
The Titans executed a textbook rebuild, using the #1 pick on a quarterback while surrounding him with protection and weapons. The Dan Moore signing addresses the most critical need - protecting Ward's blindside.

- Franchise quarterback secured with Cam Ward
- Offensive line protection significantly upgraded
- Cap space created for future roster building

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Defense lacks proven playmakers beyond Jeffrey Simmons
- Receiving corps needs development beyond Calvin Ridley

### 7. Context and Analysis

**The Travis Hunter Decision:**
"There are very few players who have the capacity to alter the trajectory of the sport itself," Gladstone said about the number of picks Jacksonville spent to move up. "Travis, while he has a lot to still learn in our eyes, has the potential to do just that".

**Organizational Philosophy:**
Moving up to get Hunter sends a significant message to the rest of the league: The Jaguars aren't going to be afraid to be bold and aggressive; in fact, that's going to be the way the franchise operates from now on.

**Historical Context:**
Gladstone, who spent nine years with the Rams' scouting department, wanted his first draft pick as the Jaguars GM to set the tone for his tenure.

**Critical Assessment:**
The Jaguars' offseason represents either a franchise-altering masterstroke or a costly gamble. CBS' Sports Tyler Sullivan landed on a 'B' for the Jaguars, noting the Travis Hunter acquisition as phenomenal but costly for a non-quarterback.

**Needs Successfully Addressed:**
- Added generational talent in Travis Hunter
- Upgraded offensive line protection significantly
- Installed proven offensive mind in Liam Coen

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Massive draft capital expenditure limits future flexibility
- Receiving corps depth behind Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr.
- Defense needs improvement beyond Hunter's contribution
