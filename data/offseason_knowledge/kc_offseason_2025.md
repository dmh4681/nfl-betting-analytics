# Chiefs navigate cap constraints while maintaining championship core

The Kansas City Chiefs entered the 2025 offseason at a crossroads, attempting to rebuild after a disappointing Super Bowl LIX loss to Philadelphia while managing severe salary cap constraints. With Patrick Mahomes entering his age-30 season, the franchise executed a calculated strategy of targeted acquisitions, strategic departures, and creative financial maneuvering to maintain their championship window. The Chiefs began the offseason projected $16.9 million over the salary cap but transformed their roster through a combination of restructures, trades, and value signings that reflect both immediate competitive needs and looming financial realities.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

The Chiefs approached external free agency with measured precision, prioritizing their most glaring need at left tackle while adding strategic depth across the roster. **Jaylon Moore** emerged as the marquee signing, joining from San Francisco on a 2-year, $30 million deal with $21.24 million fully guaranteed. The 27-year-old tackle brings starting experience from Kyle Shanahan's system, though his limited track record (only 12 career starts) represents a calculated risk at a premium position. Moore's $11.195 million cap hit in 2025 reflects the inflated market for offensive line help.

Kansas City addressed their secondary needs by signing **Kristian Fulton** from division rival Los Angeles to a 2-year, $20 million contract with $15 million guaranteed. The 26-year-old cornerback provides an experienced starter opposite Trent McDuffie, allowing the Chiefs to move McDuffie to his preferred slot position. Fulton's PFF grade ranked 15th among corners with 750+ snaps in 2024, though his injury history—never playing more than 15 games in a season—raises durability concerns.

The quarterback room received veteran depth through **Gardner Minshew**, who signed for the veteran minimum of $1.17 million with up to $12 million in playing time incentives. The former Raiders starter brings 46 career starts and familiarity with Andy Reid's offensive concepts, providing experienced insurance behind Mahomes at minimal cost. Running back **Elijah Mitchell** joined from San Francisco on a 1-year, $2.5 million deal, offering explosive speed (4.38 40-yard dash) that the Chiefs' backfield has lacked, though he missed all of 2024 with a hamstring injury and has never played more than 11 games in a season.

Defensive tackle **Jerry Tillery** rounds out the external signings on a 1-year, $1.79 million fully guaranteed contract. The former first-round pick provides versatile depth for Steve Spagnuolo's scheme, though his career has underwhelmed relative to his draft position. These targeted additions reflect a strategic approach of addressing specific needs without overspending in a constrained cap environment.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

The Chiefs' salary cap constraints forced difficult decisions, resulting in several significant departures that weakened proven depth across the roster. **Justin Reid's** exit to New Orleans on a 3-year, $31.5 million deal ($22.5 million guaranteed) represents the most impactful loss. Reid led all Chiefs safeties with 3,575 defensive snaps since 2022, serving as both a defensive signal-caller and emergency kicker. His departure creates a leadership void in the secondary that will be challenging to replace.

Offensive line depth took a hit with **Nick Allegretti** signing a 3-year, $16 million contract with Washington. Allegretti proved his worth by starting in the AFC Championship and Super Bowl when Joe Thuney was injured, but the Chiefs couldn't match the Commanders' guaranteed money and starting opportunity. The departure of **Derrick Nnadi** to the Jets marks the end of a seven-year tenure that included three Super Bowl victories. Once a reliable run-stuffer, Nnadi's role had diminished to just 221 defensive snaps in 2024, reflecting the Chiefs' shift toward a younger, more athletic defensive line.

Special teams underwent change with punter **Tommy Townsend** joining Houston on a 2-year, $6 million deal. The Chiefs prioritized cap savings by replacing him with Matt Araiza, accepting a potential downgrade at the position. Additional departures included **Tershawn Wharton** to Carolina, **D.J. Humphries** to San Francisco, and **DeAndre Hopkins** to Baltimore after his mid-season rental expired. These losses collectively represent significant experience and proven production that the Chiefs must replace with younger, cheaper alternatives.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

The Chiefs' trade activity reflected both immediate needs and long-term cap management, with two major moves reshaping the roster. The blockbuster deal sending **L'Jarius Sneed** to Tennessee in exchange for a 2025 third-round pick (#66 overall) exemplified the difficult choices facing Kansas City. Sneed immediately signed a 4-year, $76.4 million extension with the Titans, money the Chiefs simply couldn't afford while prioritizing Chris Jones. The trade freed up $19.8 million in cap space and proved prescient when Sneed suffered a season-ending quad injury after just five games in Tennessee.

Mid-season, the Chiefs addressed their injury-depleted receiver corps by acquiring **DeAndre Hopkins** from Tennessee for a conditional 2025 fifth-round pick. The veteran caught 41 passes for 437 yards and 4 touchdowns in 10 games, providing crucial depth during the playoff push. However, Hopkins played less than 60% of snaps and the Chiefs fell short of the Super Bowl, keeping the pick as a fifth-rounder rather than escalating to a fourth.

The most painful trade came in March 2025 when Kansas City sent All-Pro guard **Joe Thuney** to Chicago for a 2026 fourth-round pick. This move saved $16 million in cap space despite leaving $11 million in dead money, highlighting the severity of the Chiefs' financial constraints. Trading an elite interior lineman protecting Mahomes represents a significant gamble, with unproven Kingsley Suamataia expected to fill the void at left guard.

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

The Chiefs entered the draft with clear needs and executed a strategy focused on long-term building blocks while addressing immediate concerns. Their first-round selection of **Josh Simmons** (Pick #32, Ohio State) directly addressed the critical left tackle need. The 6'5", 310-pound tackle started the first six games for the national champions before suffering a torn patellar tendon. Widely considered excellent value as the 20th-ranked overall prospect, Simmons projects as a future franchise left tackle if he returns to pre-injury form. Mel Kiper Jr. graded the pick A-, praising the Chiefs for addressing their most glaring need.

Kansas City doubled down on the trenches with second-round pick **Omarr Norman-Lott** (#63, Tennessee), an undersized but disruptive interior pass rusher who recorded 4.5 sacks in 2024. The selection reflects Steve Spagnuolo's input and addresses the departures of Nnadi and Wharton. The third round brought excellent value with **Ashton Gillotte** (#66, Louisville)—acquired via the Sneed trade—who compiled 26.5 career sacks and adds depth behind George Karlaftis.

Secondary help arrived with **Nohl Williams** (#85, California), who led the nation with 7 interceptions while allowing just a 40.1 passer rating. The physical corner fits Spagnuolo's system perfectly, though speed concerns prevented him from going higher. Fourth-round receiver **Jalen Royals** (#133, Utah State) provides versatility to play inside or outside while offering kick return ability, crucial given the injury questions surrounding the receiver corps.

The draft's later rounds focused on special teams contributors and developmental prospects. **Jeffrey Bassa** (#156, Oregon) transitions from safety to linebacker, immediately upgrading coverage ability and special teams. Seventh-rounder **Brashard Smith** (#228, SMU) adds a dynamic pass-catching element to the backfield. Overall draft grades averaged B+, with experts praising the Chiefs' value selections while noting the continued absence of a Travis Kelce succession plan at tight end.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

Retaining core talent proved equally important as external additions, with the Chiefs making strategic investments in proven performers. The crown jewel was linebacker **Nick Bolton's** 3-year, $45 million extension featuring $30 million fully guaranteed. Bolton, who led the team with 106 tackles in 2024 and has 559 career tackles, serves as Spagnuolo's defensive quarterback. His $15 million average annual value makes him the fourth-highest paid linebacker in the NFL, reflecting his importance to the defensive scheme.

The Chiefs applied the non-exclusive franchise tag to right guard **Trey Smith**, valued at $23.4 million for 2025. This strategic move allows negotiation time for a long-term deal while ensuring Smith—a 2021 sixth-round pick who developed into a Pro Bowler—remains in Kansas City. The tag makes him the highest-paid guard in NFL history, highlighting both his value and the challenges of the offensive line market.

Wide receiver **Marquise "Hollywood" Brown** received a second chance after an injury-plagued 2024, signing a 1-year deal worth up to $11 million. The contract includes $6.5 million guaranteed with $4 million in incentives tied to touchdowns, receiving yards, and playing time. This structure protects the Chiefs while incentivizing Brown to provide the speed element they've lacked since trading Tyreek Hill.

Running back **Kareem Hunt** returned on a team-friendly 1-year, $1.5 million deal after rushing for 728 yards and 7 touchdowns in 13 games following his mid-season 2024 signing. Receiver **JuJu Smith-Schuster** also re-signed for approximately $1.2 million, maintaining his role as a reliable intermediate target for Mahomes. Perhaps most crucially, the Chiefs restructured contracts for **Patrick Mahomes** and **Chris Jones**, creating a combined $49.446 million in cap relief—though this pushes significant money into future years, with Mahomes' 2026 cap hit ballooning to $78.2 million.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

The Chiefs' coaching and front office changes reflect both continuity and strategic additions following their Super Bowl loss. The defensive staff received a boost with the return of **Matt House** as senior defensive assistant. House previously served as linebackers coach during the Super Bowl LIV championship run before stints at LSU and Jacksonville. His championship experience and familiarity with Spagnuolo's system provide valuable reinforcement for a defense seeking improvement.

Young coaching talent arrived in **Chris Orr**, a 27-year-old defensive quality control coach who transitioned from playing linebacker at Wisconsin to coaching at Jackson State. Orr's recent playing experience in the USFL and UFL brings fresh perspective to complement House's veteran presence. The defensive staff also saw internal movement with **Rod Wilson** promoted to outside linebackers coach following Ken Flajole's retirement.

The front office underwent its most significant restructuring following assistant general manager **Mike Borgonzi's** departure to become Tennessee's GM. Rather than hiring externally, Brett Veach promoted from within, elevating **Mike Bradway** and **Chris Shea** as co-leaders of the assistant GM responsibilities. This structure leverages Bradway's scouting expertise and Shea's contract negotiation skills. Additional promotions included **Ryne Nutt** and **Tim Terry** to Vice President of Player Personnel roles, maintaining institutional knowledge while providing advancement opportunities.

Core leadership remains intact with **Andy Reid** confirmed for his 13th season as head coach, **Steve Spagnuolo** continuing as defensive coordinator, **Matt Nagy** as offensive coordinator, and **Dave Toub** as special teams coordinator. This stability provides crucial continuity as the team navigates roster turnover and seeks to return to championship form.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

The Chiefs' 2025 offseason strategy was fundamentally shaped by severe salary cap constraints that forced difficult personnel decisions. Beginning the offseason $16.9 million over the projected $279.2 million cap, Kansas City executed major restructures of Mahomes and Jones to create immediate relief. However, these moves merely postpone the reckoning—the team faces a projected **$36.2 million deficit in 2026**, with Mahomes' cap hit alone reaching $78.2 million.

Injury recoveries significantly influenced roster construction. First-round pick Josh Simmons' torn patellar tendon creates uncertainty at the crucial left tackle position, while Rashee Rice's recovery timeline affects receiver depth planning. Charles Omenihu's return from an ACL tear provides needed pass rush depth, but the accumulation of players with injury histories (Mitchell, Fulton, Brown) adds risk to the roster's foundation.

The Chiefs successfully addressed their most critical need at left tackle through the Moore signing and Simmons draft pick, though neither represents a proven solution. Cornerback depth improved with Fulton's addition, allowing McDuffie to maximize his versatility. However, significant weaknesses remain unaddressed. The offensive line lacks quality depth beyond the starters, particularly concerning given injury histories. The pass rush remains heavily dependent on Chris Jones and George Karlaftis without a true third option. Safety depth disappeared with Justin Reid's departure, and the wide receiver corps still lacks a proven deep threat following Hopkins' exit.

Within the ultra-competitive AFC West, Kansas City maintains its favored status but faces mounting challenges. Denver's strong offseason built around Bo Nix, including additions of Evan Engram and Dre Greenlaw, positions them as legitimate threats. The Chargers underperformed despite ample cap space, while Las Vegas's acquisition of Pete Carroll and Geno Smith represents significant improvement from a low baseline. Power rankings project Kansas City first, Denver second, the Chargers third, and Raiders fourth, though the gap has narrowed considerably.

The Chiefs' championship window remains open but is undeniably narrowing. Mahomes enters his age-30 season still elite, Andy Reid's system remains proven, and core defensive pieces like Jones, McDuffie, and Karlaftis are in their primes. However, the combination of financial constraints forcing talent departures, an improving division, and questions at key positions suggests the dynasty's foundation shows cracks. Realistic projections place the Chiefs at 9-11 wins with a playoff appearance, though their margin for error has decreased significantly. Success in 2025 will largely depend on Mahomes' ability to elevate a weakened supporting cast—a familiar scenario that becomes increasingly difficult as organizational resources thin.
