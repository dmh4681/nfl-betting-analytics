# Cardinals reshape defense while banking on offensive continuity

The Arizona Cardinals leveraged **$74.4 million in cap space** to execute a defensive transformation in 2025, signing pass rusher Josh Sweat to a **4-year, $76.4 million deal** while drafting six defensive players in their seven-pick draft class. Under the Monti Ossenfort-Jonathan Gannon leadership, the Cardinals addressed their most glaring weakness - a pass rush that produced zero players with more than five sacks in 2024 - while maintaining offensive stability around quarterback Kyler Murray. With strategic contract extensions to core players like tight end Trey McBride and running back James Conner, Arizona positioned itself as a legitimate wild card contender in an evolving NFC West division where traditional powerhouses San Francisco and Seattle appear vulnerable.

## Josh Sweat headlines aggressive defensive free agency

The Cardinals' offseason centerpiece was reuniting edge rusher **Josh Sweat** with head coach Jonathan Gannon, his former defensive coordinator in Philadelphia. Sweat's **$76.4 million contract** represents the largest free agent signing in the Ossenfort era, with **$38 million fully guaranteed** at signing. The structure shows financial savvy - just a **$7.24 million cap hit in 2025** before escalating in future years. Sweat brings proven production with **43 career sacks** since 2019, including 18.5 during his most productive seasons under Gannon's system in Philadelphia.

Beyond Sweat, Arizona targeted interior defensive strength by signing **Dalvin Tomlinson** to a 2-year, $29 million deal. The 31-year-old tackle anchored Cleveland's league-best run defense in 2024 and fills a critical void after the Cardinals lost **957 combined defensive snaps** from departing linemen Roy Lopez, Khyiris Tonga, and Naquan Jones. The Cardinals also added veteran quarterback **Jacoby Brissett** on a 2-year, $12.5 million contract to provide experienced insurance behind Murray, addressing their historical quarterback durability concerns.

Strategic re-signings maintained roster continuity, particularly along the offensive line where guard **Evan Brown** (2-year, $11.4 million) and tackle **Kelvin Beachum** (2-year, $5.15 million) return as key protectors for Murray. The Cardinals also retained edge rusher **Baron Browning** on a 2-year, $16 million extension after acquiring him via trade from Denver, adding another proven pass rusher to their rebuilt defensive front.

## Draft delivers potential defensive cornerstones

Arizona's 2025 draft reflected an all-in commitment to defensive improvement, selecting defense with six of seven picks. The Cardinals capitalized on medical concerns to land potential first-round talents later than expected, starting with **Walter Nolen III** at 16th overall. The Ole Miss defensive tackle posted a **91.6 PFF run-defense grade** (second in FBS) while adding 6.5 sacks as an interior rusher. His pairing with veterans Tomlinson and Calais Campbell creates a potentially dominant interior defensive line.

The steal of the draft came in round two when Michigan cornerback **Will Johnson** fell to 47th overall due to injury concerns. When healthy, Johnson profiles as an immediate CB1 candidate - he allowed just **17 receptions on 37 targets** without a touchdown in 2023 while recording three pick-sixes in his career. Third-round selection **Jordan Burch** from Oregon adds edge rush depth with 8.5 sacks in 2024, while fourth-rounder **Cody Simon** addresses linebacker needs after posting 112 tackles and earning **CFP National Championship Defensive MVP** honors at Ohio State.

The Cardinals traded their original fifth-round pick to Dallas for two later selections, adding Ohio State cornerback **Denzel Burke** and Texas guard **Hayden Conner**. The draft's only offensive selection, Conner allowed **zero sacks on 617 pass-blocking snaps** in 2024. Seventh-rounder **Kitan Crawford** from Nevada provides special teams value with an 88.5 PFF coverage grade. Draft experts lauded Arizona's haul - Pro Football Focus awarded an **A+ grade** (one of only three teams), while ESPN's Matt Miller called Johnson the **second-best value pick** in the entire draft.

## Coaching continuity meets strategic position upgrades

The Cardinals maintained their core leadership structure with Jonathan Gannon and coordinators Drew Petzing (offense) and Nick Rallis (defense) all returning. However, significant position coach changes addressed specific needs. The departure of offensive line coach Klayton Adams to Dallas created an opportunity to hire **Justin Frye** from Ohio State, who previously coached Cardinals left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. at UCLA. The defensive staff underwent broader changes, with new coaches for defensive line (**Winston DeLattiboudere III**, age 27), inside linebackers (**Cristian Garcia**), and outside linebackers (**Matt Feeney**).

These hires reflect a clear pattern - young, energetic coaches with connections to the Gannon-Rallis defensive philosophy. DeLattiboudere was Rallis's college teammate at Minnesota, while Garcia worked under Mike Zimmer, a mentor to both coordinators. The emphasis on scheme familiarity and cultural fit aligns with Gannon's stated focus on accountability and player development entering his third season.

Contract extensions secured the offensive core around Murray. Tight end **Trey McBride** signed a 4-year, $76 million extension after his breakout season (111 receptions, 1,146 yards), briefly becoming the NFL's highest-paid tight end. Running back **James Conner** extended for 2 years and $19 million, providing leadership and consistency after back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. These deals, structured with **$6.5 million and manageable cap hits** in 2025, demonstrate the front office's ability to retain talent while maintaining flexibility.

## Financial flexibility positions Cardinals for sustained competition

Entering 2025 with **$75.5 million in effective cap space** (fourth-most in the NFL), the Cardinals executed a patient approach that addressed immediate needs while preserving future options. The team rolled over **$11.3 million** from 2024 and strategically structured new contracts to maintain flexibility. Sweat's deal exemplifies this approach - the **$7.24 million** first-year cap hit allowed room for other moves while deferring larger hits to when the cap is expected to rise further.

The Cardinals successfully addressed their most critical needs. The pass rush transformation from **41 total sacks** with no player exceeding five sacks to a unit featuring Sweat, Browning, and rookie Burch represents a fundamental shift. Interior defensive line depth went from a weakness losing nearly 1,000 snaps to a strength with Tomlinson, Campbell, and first-rounder Nolen. The secondary added potential CB1 Johnson and depth with Burke, while linebacker received reinforcement through Simon's selection and Akeem Davis-Gaither's free agent signing.

However, notable gaps remain. The offensive line's right side remains unsettled after losing Will Hernandez to injury, with only depth signing Royce Newman added. Most significantly, the Cardinals added **zero offensive skill position players** in free agency and used just one draft pick on offense, banking entirely on internal development from Marvin Harrison Jr. and existing weapons to support Murray.

## Murray's make-or-break season shapes offensive approach

The Cardinals' offensive strategy reflects supreme confidence in Kyler Murray's health and the existing supporting cast. Murray completed his first full 17-game season since 2020, posting **3,851 passing yards** with 21 touchdowns while adding 572 rushing yards. Reports indicate he feels "100% healthy" and expects increased designed runs in 2025. The minimal offensive additions - essentially just sixth-round guard Hayden Conner - suggest the team believes continuity and health, not new pieces, will drive offensive improvement.

The retention of coordinator Drew Petzing and his "controlled chaos" offensive philosophy provides system continuity entering year two. With Paris Johnson Jr. establishing himself at left tackle and Evan Brown returning at left guard, the blind side protection appears solid. However, questions persist about right guard after Hernandez's injury and right tackle Jonah Williams' recovery from knee issues. The receiving corps returns intact with Harrison, McBride's elite production, and Conner's dual-threat ability, but lacks proven depth beyond the starters.

## Division dynamics favor Cardinals' patient approach

The NFC West landscape shifted dramatically in 2025, creating an opportunity for Arizona's rebuilt roster. The **Los Angeles Rams** remain favorites after adding Davante Adams and retaining their core around Matthew Stafford, projecting for 12-plus wins if healthy. However, the **49ers face significant transition** with veteran departures and cap constraints suggesting regression from their recent dominance. Most surprisingly, **Seattle's puzzling offseason** - replacing Geno Smith with Sam Darnold, trading DK Metcalf, and releasing Tyler Lockett - appears to have substantially weakened their roster.

Arizona's defensive overhaul positions them as the division's most improved team. The potential defensive line featuring Sweat, Tomlinson, Campbell, and Nolen could rank among the NFL's best units. Combined with Murray's dual-threat ability when healthy and **$75 million in cap flexibility** for potential midseason additions, the Cardinals project as legitimate wild card contenders with an outside shot at challenging the Rams for the division title.

The Cardinals' measured approach contrasts with division rivals' extremes - the Rams' all-in additions versus Seattle's apparent teardown. Arizona built sustainable depth while maintaining financial flexibility, suggesting a multi-year competitive window rather than a single-season push. Their Week 18 matchup against the Rams could determine the division if both teams meet expectations.

## Cardinals position for playoffs through defensive identity

The 2025 Arizona Cardinals represent a fascinating study in modern roster construction - aggressively addressing glaring weaknesses while trusting established strengths. The **$76.4 million** investment in Josh Sweat signals organizational commitment to defensive improvement, while the draft's defensive focus (six of seven picks) reinforces this priority. GM Monti Ossenfort's patient approach accumulated the cap space and draft capital to execute this transformation without mortgaging the future.

Success hinges on three factors: Murray's continued health and development in his make-or-break seventh season, the defensive additions meshing quickly under the Gannon-Rallis system, and the existing offensive weapons proving sufficient without reinforcement. The floor appears to be 8-9 wins with continued development, while the ceiling could reach 11-12 wins and division contention if the defensive transformation materializes as projected. Most realistically, Arizona projects for 9-11 wins and wild card contention in a division where only the Rams appear clearly superior. For a franchise with just one playoff appearance in Murray's six seasons, that represents meaningful progress while maintaining the flexibility for continued building.
