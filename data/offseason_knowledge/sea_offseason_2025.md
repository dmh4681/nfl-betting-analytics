# Seattle Seahawks pivot toward run-heavy identity in dramatic 2025 offseason overhaul

The Seattle Seahawks executed one of the NFL's most comprehensive roster transformations during the 2025 offseason, trading away franchise cornerstones Geno Smith and DK Metcalf while reshaping their offensive philosophy under new coordinator Klint Kubiak. Seattle's aggressive moves addressed their most critical weakness—the offensive line—while betting on quarterback Sam Darnold's career resurgence and maintaining defensive continuity under second-year head coach Mike Macdonald. The Seahawks created over $50 million in cap space through veteran departures, enabling strategic signings that align with their vision of physical, run-first football. This calculated pivot positions Seattle as a wild-card contender with significant upside if their key acquisitions stay healthy and perform.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

Seattle's free agency approach centered on reuniting players with familiar coaching connections while addressing specific scheme needs. The marquee signing was **quarterback Sam Darnold**, who inked a 3-year, $100.5 million deal with $55 million guaranteed after his Pro Bowl season in Minnesota. Darnold's career-best 2024 campaign (4,319 yards, 35 TDs, 102.5 passer rating) made him an attractive option, particularly given his previous connection with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. The Seahawks also brought home **Cooper Kupp**, the Yakima native and 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year, on a 3-year, $45 million contract with $17.5 million fully guaranteed at signing. Kupp's addition provides immediate WR1 production and leadership following the departures of Metcalf and Tyler Lockett.

Defensively, Seattle added veteran pass rusher **DeMarcus Lawrence** on a 3-year deal worth up to $42 million, banking on the four-time Pro Bowler bouncing back from an injury-shortened 2024 season. The Seahawks also signed **Marquez Valdes-Scantling** (1-year, $4 million base) to provide deep threat capability, reuniting him with Kubiak from their time in New Orleans. Offensive line depth came via **Josh Jones** (1-year, up to $4.75 million), who can play multiple positions along the line.

Additional signings focused on special teams and depth, including cornerback **Shemar Jean-Charles**, safety **D'Anthony Bell**, tight end **Eric Saubert**, receiver **Steven Sims Jr.**, and the return of backup quarterback **Drew Lock** to provide experienced depth behind Darnold.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

The Seahawks' roster teardown included several shocking moves that reshaped the offensive identity. Most notably, **Geno Smith** was traded to Las Vegas after contract negotiations stalled when he sought over $45 million annually. **DK Metcalf** followed him out the door via trade to Pittsburgh after reportedly requesting a move due to quarterback uncertainty and seeking a $30 million annual contract. The team also released franchise icon **Tyler Lockett** to save $31 million in cap space, ending his 10-year tenure that produced 910 receptions for 8,779 yards and 56 touchdowns.

On the offensive line, starting left guard **Laken Tomlinson** departed for Houston on a modest 2-year, $3.75 million deal, likely qualifying Seattle for a compensatory pick. Defensively, the Seahawks cut ties with **Dre'Mont Jones**, **Roy Robertson-Harris**, and **Rayshawn Jenkins** for cap savings. Additional departures included cornerbacks **Tre Brown** (signed with division rival San Francisco) and **Artie Burns**, tackle **Stone Forsythe**, and tight end **Pharaoh Brown**.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

Seattle's trade activity fundamentally altered their offensive core while accumulating draft capital. The **Geno Smith trade** to Las Vegas netted a 3rd round pick (92nd overall) while saving $31 million in cap space. The **DK Metcalf trade** to Pittsburgh brought back more substantial compensation: a 2nd round pick (52nd overall) and 7th rounder (233rd), plus a swap of 6th round picks. Both moves were driven by contract disputes and philosophical differences about the team's direction.

During the draft, Seattle traded up from pick 52 to 35 in the second round, packaging their 52nd and 82nd selections to Tennessee to select safety Nick Emmanwori. The Seahawks also moved backup quarterback **Sam Howell** to Minnesota after drafting Jalen Milroe, creating roster space and additional assets. Reports indicate Seattle explored a blockbuster deal with Las Vegas for pass rusher Maxx Crosby that would have included both Smith and Metcalf, but the Raiders quickly shut down discussions.

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

The Seahawks entered the draft with 10 picks and emerged with 11 selections, directly addressing their most critical needs. Their first-round selection of **Grey Zabel** (18th overall) from North Dakota State filled the offensive line void with a consensus All-American who projects as an immediate starter at guard. GM John Schneider then traded up in the second round to select **Nick Emmanwori**, a versatile safety from South Carolina who drew comparisons to Kam Chancellor and fits perfectly in Mike Macdonald's defensive scheme.

The offensive rebuild continued with tight end **Elijah Arroyo** (50th overall) from Miami, whose 16.9 yards per reception led all FBS tight ends with 20+ catches. Perhaps the most intriguing selection came at pick 92 when Seattle drafted quarterback **Jalen Milroe** from Alabama, marking only the third QB selected by Schneider in 16 years. The dual-threat quarterback's 726 rushing yards and 20 rushing touchdowns provide a different dimension behind Darnold.

Day three focused on depth and special teams, with receiver **Tory Horton** (166th) bringing Tyler Lockett-like speed and return ability, fullback **Robbie Ouzts** (175th) adding a 275-pound lead blocker for the run game, and additional offensive line depth through **Bryce Cabeldue** (192nd) and **Mason Richman** (234th). Running back **Damien Martinez** (223rd) proclaimed himself "Beast Mode 2.0" after his selection, while receiver **Ricky White III** (238th) brings elite special teams ability after blocking four punts in college. The Seahawks also signed 17 undrafted free agents, with 11 defensive players balancing their offense-heavy draft class.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

Seattle prioritized retaining key defensive pieces while managing their cap situation. The most significant extension went to linebacker **Ernest Jones IV**, who signed a 3-year, $33 million deal with $15 million guaranteed just before free agency opened. Jones transformed Seattle's run defense after his midseason acquisition from Tennessee, recording 94 tackles in just 10 games. Veteran defensive tackle **Jarran Reed** also received a multi-year extension worth $25 million total with $10 million guaranteed, maintaining continuity as the last remaining player from the Legion of Boom era.

Emerging cornerback **Josh Jobe** was re-signed after a breakout 2024 season where he transitioned from practice squad to starter, posting career highs with 7 passes defensed and 37 tackles. The team also retained special teams contributors **Cody White**, **Josh Ross**, and **Brady Russell** on team-friendly deals. Notably absent from this list are any offensive skill position players, reflecting the complete philosophical overhaul on that side of the ball.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

The most significant change came with the January 6th firing of offensive coordinator **Ryan Grubb** after just one season. Despite the offense ranking 14th in total yards, philosophical differences with head coach Mike Macdonald about offensive identity led to the change. Grubb's pass-heavy approach conflicted with Macdonald's vision for a physical, run-first team. His replacement, **Klint Kubiak**, brings extensive coordinator experience from Minnesota (2021) and New Orleans (2024), plus a stint as passing game coordinator with San Francisco (2023).

Kubiak's hiring represented more than just a coordinator change—it signaled a complete offensive philosophy shift. He brought several assistants from New Orleans, including offensive line coach **John Benton** and run game coordinator **Rick Dennison**. Defensive coordinator **Aden Durde** and special teams coordinator **Jay Harbaugh** were retained from 2024, providing continuity on those units. GM **John Schneider** continues in his elevated role as President of Football Operations with final say over personnel decisions, entering his 16th season leading Seattle's front office. Head coach **Mike Macdonald** enters Year 2 after posting 10 wins in his debut season, the most by a first-year coach in franchise history.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

Seattle entered the offseason $11.3 million over the projected cap but created over $50 million in space through strategic moves. The releases of Tyler Lockett ($31M saved), Dre'Mont Jones, Roy Robertson-Harris, Rayshawn Jenkins, and George Fant combined with the trades of Smith and Metcalf freed up massive financial flexibility. Leonard Williams also restructured his deal for approximately $14 million in additional savings. The team currently sits with an estimated $30+ million in available cap space and minimal dead money obligations.

The offensive line ranked as Seattle's most critical need after finishing 30th in pass protection and allowing 54 sacks (3rd-most in NFL). The selection of Grey Zabel addresses the immediate starting need, though experts note they likely need 1-2 more interior starters for adequate depth. The quarterback transition from Smith to Darnold represents both risk and opportunity—getting younger and cheaper while banking on Darnold maintaining his 2024 form. The receiving corps overhaul hinges heavily on Cooper Kupp's health, creating significant uncertainty despite Jaxon Smith-Njigba's emergence (100 catches, 1,130 yards in 2024).

Defensively, the Seahawks successfully retained their core after ranking 6th overall in 2024, with Ernest Jones' extension proving crucial. The addition of DeMarcus Lawrence provides veteran pass rush help, though depth remains a concern. Unaddressed needs include center position clarity between Olu Oluwatimi and Jalen Sundell, cornerback depth beyond the starting trio, and additional offensive line help. The team's projected win total dropped from 10 to 8.5-9.5 wins, with playoff odds in the 40-50% range as they navigate significant roster turnover while competing in a tough NFC West where even the 6-11 49ers remain slight division favorites due to their established core.
