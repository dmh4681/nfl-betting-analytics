# Pittsburgh Steelers' 2025 offseason transformation

The Pittsburgh Steelers executed a dramatic roster overhaul centered on acquiring DK Metcalf while simultaneously losing both starting quarterbacks and pursuing Aaron Rodgers. Despite adding the NFL's highest-paid wide receiver in total contract value ($150 million), the team's championship aspirations hinge entirely on resolving their quarterback situation. The Steelers employed a hybrid strategy balancing win-now moves with future-building elements, though this approach has created significant roster uncertainty heading into the 2025 season.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

The Steelers took a measured approach to free agency, prioritizing defensive depth and veteran leadership while maintaining salary cap flexibility. Their most significant defensive additions included **Darius Slay** from Philadelphia (1-year, $10 million), bringing Super Bowl-winning experience to reunite with defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. The 34-year-old cornerback started 14 games and played 81% of defensive snaps for the Eagles in 2024.

**Juan Thornhill** joined from Kansas City on a 1-year, $3 million deal, adding another championship pedigree despite injury concerns that limited him to 11 games in 2024. In a notable victory over division rival Baltimore, Pittsburgh signed linebacker **Malik Harrison** to a 2-year, $10 million contract, continuing their trend of poaching Ravens defenders after Patrick Queen's arrival in 2024.

The offensive additions were minimal, highlighted by running back **Kenneth Gainwell** from Philadelphia (1-year, $1.79 million with $620K guaranteed), who brings versatility with 290 rushing yards and 116 receiving yards from 2024. Most controversially, the Steelers brought back **Mason Rudolph** on a 2-year, $8 million deal as a bridge quarterback option while pursuing Aaron Rodgers.

Additional depth signings included Brandin Echols (CB), Daniel Ekuale (DT), and the re-signings of Ben Skowronek (WR), Scotty Miller (WR), James Pierre (CB), and Isiahh Loudermilk (DE) to maintain roster continuity.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

The quarterback exodus defined Pittsburgh's offseason losses. **Justin Fields** departed for the New York Jets on a 2-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed, taking with him a 4-2 starting record and promising dual-threat ability. **Russell Wilson** signed a 1-year deal with the New York Giants, leaving after an 11-game stint that ended with a late-season collapse.

The offensive line suffered major losses with **Dan Moore Jr.** signing a massive 4-year, $82 million contract ($50 million guaranteed) with Tennessee, creating a significant hole at left tackle. Guard **James Daniels** joined Miami on a 3-year, $24 million deal, further depleting the offensive line depth.

**Najee Harris**, after four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, signed a 1-year deal worth up to $9.25 million with the Los Angeles Chargers. The Steelers also lost defensive depth with cornerback **Donte Jackson** joining the Chargers (2-years, $13 million) and released defensive lineman **Larry Ogunjobi**, who signed with Buffalo for 1-year, $8.3 million.

Wide receivers Van Jefferson (Tennessee, 1-year, $2.5 million) and Mike Williams (Jets, 1-year) departed, though their losses were overshadowed by the subsequent Metcalf acquisition.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

The Steelers made franchise-altering moves in the trade market, headlined by the **DK Metcalf blockbuster**. Pittsburgh acquired the elite receiver from Seattle in exchange for their 2025 2nd round pick (#52) and 7th round pick (#223), receiving Metcalf and a 6th round pick (#185) in return. Metcalf immediately signed a 5-year, $150 million extension with $60 million guaranteed, creating a manageable $11 million cap hit in 2025 before escalating to $41.5 million by 2029.

In a surprising May move, the Steelers traded **George Pickens** to Dallas along with a 2027 6th round pick, receiving a 2026 3rd round pick and 2027 5th round pick. The trade addressed character concerns and route-running issues while avoiding redundancy with Metcalf's skill set. This move also stockpiled draft capital for a potential 2026 quarterback pursuit.

During the draft, Pittsburgh executed a minor trade with Kansas City, moving back from pick #156 to #164 while acquiring an additional 7th round selection (#226).

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

Pittsburgh's draft strategy emphasized defensive reinforcement with 5 of 7 selections on that side of the ball. Their first-round pick (#21 overall) was **Derrick Harmon**, defensive tackle from Oregon, who led FBS with 34 quarterback pressures as an interior lineman. Mike Tomlin praised his "Steelers DNA," projecting him as an immediate starter alongside Cameron Heyward and eventual successor.

Third-round selection **Kaleb Johnson** (RB, Iowa) addressed the Najee Harris departure with a physical, patient runner who fell from projected second-round value. Fourth-round pick **Jack Sawyer** (OLB, Ohio State) provided excellent value with a 15.9% pressure rate and clutch Rose Bowl performance, adding depth behind T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith.

The Steelers continued their Big Ten focus with fifth-round pick **Yahya Black** (DT, Iowa), a versatile run-stuffer who earned Honorable Mention All-Big Ten honors. Sixth-round selection **Will Howard** (QB, Ohio State) represents a developmental prospect behind the veteran options, bringing national championship experience despite arm strength concerns.

Seventh-round picks included **Carson Bruener** (LB, Washington), son of former Steelers tight end Mark Bruener, and **Donte Kent** (CB, Central Michigan), a local product with return skills. Expert draft grades ranged from B- to A, averaging a 3.10 GPA (16th of 32 teams), with praise for value selections and scheme fits despite limited offensive line investment.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

Beyond the Metcalf extension, the Steelers' most significant pending move involves **T.J. Watt**, who enters the final year of his 4-year, $112 million deal. With Myles Garrett's market-resetting $40 million AAV contract, industry experts project Watt commanding a 3-year, $108 million fully guaranteed extension ($36 million AAV). Watt's absence from voluntary OTAs signals contract priority.

The team applied a second-round tender to running back **Jaylen Warren** worth $5.346 million, securing the key complementary back. Safety **DeShon Elliott** emerged as a top extension priority after recording career-highs with 108 tackles, 6 pass defenses, and 3 fumble recoveries in 2024. His projected 2-year, $18.5 million extension would triple his current salary.

Multiple role players received new deals, including Ben Skowronek (WR, 2 years), Scotty Miller (WR, 1 year), Isaiahh Loudermilk (DL, 1 year), and James Pierre (CB). The Steelers also retained special teams contributors Cameron Moon and Breiden Fehoko on one-year deals.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

Mike Tomlin maintained staff continuity with minimal changes, retaining offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin despite late-season struggles. The most significant departures involved position coaches **Aaron Curry** (inside linebackers) and **Grady Brown** (secondary), whose contracts weren't renewed after communication breakdowns contributed to defensive failures against Kansas City and Baltimore.

Curry's issues included coordination problems with Patrick Queen wearing the green dot communication device, while Brown's unit suffered blown coverages in crucial games. Both coaches were viewed as rising stars - Curry joined the Jets and Brown had generated defensive coordinator interest.

The Steelers hired **Gerald Alexander** as secondary coach, bringing back a familiar face who served as assistant DB coach from 2022-2023 before spending 2024 with Las Vegas. Alexander's NFL playing experience (2007-2011) and familiarity with Pittsburgh's system made him an ideal internal promotion. Scott McCurry is widely expected to replace Curry as linebackers coach, though official announcement remains pending.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

The Steelers enter 2025 with approximately **$31-34 million in cap space**, ranking 8th in the NFL after beginning the offseason with over $63 million. Their dead money sits at an exceptionally low $3.6 million, reflecting their philosophy of avoiding void years in contracts. The team saved $7 million by releasing Larry Ogunjobi and could create additional space through potential restructures of T.J. Watt ($10+ million), Pat Freiermuth ($7.2 million), or Alex Highsmith ($8+ million).

**Critical needs successfully addressed** included wide receiver (Metcalf acquisition), defensive line depth (Harmon draft pick), and running back (Johnson draft pick, Warren tender). However, **significant holes remain** at quarterback pending the Rodgers decision, offensive line depth after losing Moore and Daniels, and interior defensive line behind the aging Cameron Heyward.

The **Aaron Rodgers pursuit remains ongoing**, with contract parameters reportedly agreed upon (1-year deal, estimated $25-35 million) but the future Hall of Famer uncommitted between Pittsburgh, Minnesota, and retirement. The Steelers' willingness to wait until training camp demonstrates both patience and desperation at the position.

## Mike Tomlin's strategic vision shapes conservative transformation

The 2025 offseason reflects Tomlin's 18th season walking a tightrope between maintaining his never-had-a-losing-season streak and breaking an 8-year playoff win drought. His influence shaped key decisions, including the Pickens trade and minimal coaching changes despite fan frustration. The hybrid approach - combining the Metcalf blockbuster with compensatory pick preservation - creates a roster capable of competing if Rodgers arrives but vulnerable to mediocrity without him.

The Metcalf acquisition represents Pittsburgh's most aggressive offensive move in years, yet the failure to adequately address quarterback and offensive line concerns undermines its impact. The defensive-heavy draft maintains Tomlin's identity while potentially missing the offensive transformation window Arthur Smith's system requires.

Financial discipline remains exemplary with minimal dead money and future flexibility, positioning the Steelers for a potential 2026 quarterback draft class pursuit. However, this patient approach risks wasting the remaining prime years of Watt, Heyward, and Minkah Fitzpatrick. The competition with Baltimore highlights this strategic tension - while the Ravens aggressively maximized Lamar Jackson's window, Pittsburgh's measured moves may have already conceded the 2025 division race.
