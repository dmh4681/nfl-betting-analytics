# Los Angeles Chargers 2025 Offseason Comprehensive Analysis

## The Chargers position themselves as Chiefs challengers through calculated roster building

The Los Angeles Chargers took a measured, draft-centric approach to their 2025 offseason, creating $25.36 million in cap space by releasing franchise icon Joey Bosa while making targeted additions to support Justin Herbert. Under the collaborative leadership of Jim Harbaugh and GM Joe Hortiz, the team prioritized offensive line protection, running game enhancement, and maintaining their league-leading defense while positioning themselves with $110.8 million in projected 2026 cap space. The Chargers' conservative free agency strategy focused on one-year prove-it deals and internal retention, highlighted by keeping pass rusher Khalil Mack on a fully guaranteed $18 million extension. Their draft haul, headlined by running back Omarion Hampton and receiver Tre Harris, earned widespread praise for addressing critical needs while maintaining long-term flexibility in their pursuit to dethrone Kansas City in the AFC West.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

### Major impact signings reshape offensive identity

The Chargers' most significant external addition was **guard Mekhi Becton**, signing the Super Bowl champion to a 2-year, $20 million deal ($10M APY, $6.94M guaranteed). The 6'7", 363-pound former Eagles starter immediately addresses the team's biggest weakness on the interior offensive line, where he helped Saquon Barkley rush for 2,000+ yards in Philadelphia. This signing represents the Harbaugh regime's commitment to physical football and protecting Herbert.

**Running back Najee Harris** joined on a 1-year deal worth up to $9.25 million ($5.25M base plus $4M in rushing incentives), bringing a proven track record as the only active player with 1,000+ rushing yards in each of the last four seasons. Harris's 77.9 PFF grade ranked 14th among running backs in 2024, and his physical style perfectly fits Greg Roman's ground-and-pound offensive philosophy. The veteran presence pairs with first-round pick Omarion Hampton to completely overhaul the Chargers' backfield.

The Chargers brought **Mike Williams** home on a 1-year, $6 million deal after his disappointing stint with Pittsburgh. The 6'4" receiver provides the size and physicality the offense lacked, having previously recorded 1,000+ yard seasons in 2019 and 2021 with Herbert. At cornerback, **Donte Jackson** signed a 2-year, $13 million deal ($7M guaranteed) after recording a career-high 5 interceptions with Pittsburgh, though his 49.4 PFF grade raises durability questions.

### Depth additions provide veteran leadership

**Tyler Conklin** (1-year, $3M) replaces departed Stone Smartt at tight end, bringing reliable hands from his Jets tenure where he caught 51 passes for 449 yards. The Chargers added interior line depth with **Andre James** from division rival Las Vegas, while defensive tackle signings **Da'Shawn Hand** (1-year, up to $3.35M) and **Naquan Jones** help offset the loss of Poona Ford. Cornerback **Benjamin St-Juste** provides size at 6'3" after starting 14 games for Washington, while linebacker **Del'Shawn Phillips** brings special teams expertise from Baltimore, reuniting with GM Hortiz.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

### Franchise icon Bosa headlines major defensive departures

The Chargers' most significant loss came via release rather than free agency, as they cut **Joey Bosa** on March 5 to save $25.36 million against the cap. The five-time Pro Bowler and franchise's second all-time sack leader (72 career sacks) signed with Buffalo for 1-year, $12.6 million. Despite his legendary status, Bosa's injury history—missing 20 games from 2022-2023 and managing just 5 sacks in 14 games last season—made his $36.47 million cap hit untenable.

**Defensive tackle Poona Ford** represented perhaps the most impactful on-field loss, signing a 3-year deal worth $27.6-29.6 million with the Rams. Ford's 2024 production (39 tackles, 3 sacks, 8 TFL, 9 QB hits, 1 INT) was crucial to the Chargers' league-leading scoring defense. His 92.6 PFF run defense grade will be difficult to replace, particularly given the modest defensive line additions.

Wide receiver **Joshua Palmer** departed for Buffalo on a 3-year, $29 million deal after never fully capitalizing on his opportunities behind Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. His 39 catches for 584 yards represented solid depth production that must now be replaced. Tight end **Stone Smartt** (Jets) and linebacker **Nick Niemann** (Texans, 2-years, $6.5M) represented smaller losses, though Smartt had emerged as a fan favorite after stepping up during injuries.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

### Limited trade activity reflects draft-focused approach

The Chargers' primary "trade" activity centered on the calculated release of Joey Bosa rather than traditional player-for-player or pick swaps. This move, while technically a release, functioned as a roster-reshaping decision that freed significant cap space for other moves.

The team did execute a minor draft-day trade, **moving up in the 5th round** by sending picks 181 and 209 to select tight end Oronde Gadsden II at 165. This targeted move addressed their need for a vertical threat at the position, with Gadsden ranking 2nd among college tight ends with 9 deep catches and maintaining a 60.7% contested catch rate.

The retention of **Elijah Molden**, who was acquired via trade from Tennessee in 2024, proved significant as they extended him to a 3-year, $18.75 million deal. This move essentially completed the 2024 trade by securing a key defensive back for the long term.

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

### Draft class earns universal praise for addressing needs

The Chargers' 9-pick draft haul earned grades ranging from B+ to A from major outlets, with consensus praising their ability to address needs without reaching. **Round 1, Pick 22: RB Omarion Hampton (North Carolina)** immediately becomes the centerpiece of Harbaugh's rushing attack. The 5'11", 220-pound back rushed for 3,164 yards over his final two college seasons—second-most in FBS behind only Ashton Jeanty. His 1,450 rushing yards between the tackles since 2022 led all FBS runners, showcasing the power and vision Harbaugh covets.

**Round 2, Pick 55: WR Tre Harris (Ole Miss)** addresses the desperate need for a vertical threat, despite injury concerns that limited him to 8 games in 2024. When healthy, Harris dominated with 128.8 receiving yards per game (FBS-leading) and a 95.0 PFF grade against man coverage. His 54 receptions of 15+ yards over the past two seasons provide Herbert with the deep threat missing since Mike Williams' departure.

**Round 3, Pick 86: DT Jamaree Caldwell (Oregon)** helps replace Poona Ford with his 340-pound frame and 92.6 PFF run-defense grade. While limited as a pass rusher, Caldwell's run-stuffing ability fits Jesse Minter's defensive scheme. **Round 4, Pick 125: EDGE Kyle Kennard (South Carolina)** led the SEC with 11.5 sacks in his lone season, earning conference Defensive Player of the Year honors to provide edge depth.

### Later rounds yield potential impact players

**Round 5** brought two selections: **WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith (Auburn)** adds 4.37 speed (94th percentile) as a field-stretcher, marking the 7th receiver drafted by the Chargers in three years. The team traded up for **TE Oronde Gadsden II (Syracuse)**, whose 73 catches for 934 yards and 7 TDs showcase the seam-stretching ability their offense lacked.

**Round 6** additions **OG Branson Taylor (Pittsburgh)** and **S R.J. Mickens (Clemson)** provide depth, with Mickens representing exceptional value as PFF's 108th-ranked prospect at pick 214. Taylor's 6'6", 330-pound frame adds interior line competition despite a season-ending knee injury. **Round 7, Pick 256: CB Trikweze Bridges (Florida)** closes the draft as a developmental defensive back who allowed zero touchdowns in coverage.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

### Mack retention headlines crucial internal moves

The Chargers' top offseason priority was retaining **Khalil Mack**, accomplished with a 1-year, fully guaranteed $18 million deal. The future Hall of Famer's 23 sacks over the past two seasons and veteran leadership proved invaluable to the league's top scoring defense. This move, combined with Bosa's departure, firmly establishes Mack as the defensive cornerstone for 2025.

**Elijah Molden's** 3-year, $18.75 million extension (signed February 20) secured the versatile defensive back acquired via 2024 trade. His flexibility to play safety and nickel corner provides crucial depth behind Derwin James. **Bradley Bozeman** received a 2-year extension worth up to $12 million despite uncertainty about his 2025 role, with GM Hortiz indicating Zion Johnson will see center snaps.

The special teams trio received long-term security: **Cameron Dicker's** 4-year, $22.04 million extension (signed August 2024) locks up the NFL's most accurate kicker (94.5% career FG rate), while **J.K. Scott** earned a multi-year extension after averaging 46.7 yards per punt. Defensive tackle **Teair Tart** and linebackers **Troy Dye** and **Denzel Perryman** received extensions, providing depth and special teams excellence.

Additional depth retention included wide receiver **Jalen Reagor** (multi-year extension) and the exclusive rights tender for tight end **Tucker Fisk**. The team also signed 10 players to reserve/futures contracts and 18 undrafted free agents, maintaining their pipeline of developmental talent.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

### Continuity dominates after successful first season

Jim Harbaugh's coaching staff remains remarkably intact following their 11-6 playoff season, with the only notable change being **Dylan Roney's promotion to EDGE coach** in February 2025. Roney, who followed Harbaugh from Michigan as a defensive assistant, takes on increased responsibility in developing the pass rush post-Bosa. His promotion was viewed as crucial to retaining Khalil Mack and signals the organization's commitment to internal development.

The retention of coordinators **Greg Roman (offense)** and **Jesse Minter (defense)** maintains schematic continuity despite some fan criticism of Roman's conservative approach. Minter's defense finished first in scoring (17.7 PPG allowed) by unleashing Derwin James in creative ways, playing him at slot corner (361 snaps) more than free safety (234 snaps). **Ryan Ficken** returns as special teams coordinator after overseeing the league's most accurate kicking unit.

Supporting offensive coaches **Marcus Brady (passing game coordinator)** and **Marc Trestman (senior offensive assistant)** remain in place, providing veteran guidance for Herbert's continued development. The stability extends to the front office, where **Joe Hortiz** enters his second season as GM with no reported changes to the scouting department. This continuity reflects Harbaugh and Hortiz's "Batman and Robin" partnership approach to roster building.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

### Strategic cap management positions team for sustained success

The Chargers enter June 2025 with **$26.8 million in current cap space** after their moves, having created flexibility through Bosa's release while maintaining a conservative approach to free agency. More importantly, they project **$110.8 million in 2026 cap space**, providing ammunition for future extensions (Rashawn Slater, Joe Alt) and potential splash signings. The team's philosophy of one-year prove-it deals in free agency maintains this flexibility while allowing young players to develop.

**Needs successfully addressed** include running back (Harris/Hampton), interior offensive line (Becton), and cornerback depth (Jackson/St-Juste). The receiving corps gained size with Williams' return and speed through Harris/Lambert-Smith. However, **critical holes remain** at interior defensive line following Poona Ford's departure—the additions of Hand and Jones represent depth rather than starting-caliber replacements. Wide receiver depth beyond Ladd McConkey remains questionable, and linebacker depth behind Daiyan Henley needs development.

The team's **injury management** from 2024 influenced their approach: Herbert's ankle issues drove the offensive line investments, while Asante Samuel Jr.'s shoulder problems (IR) highlighted the need for cornerback depth. The philosophical shift under Hortiz mirrors Baltimore's draft-centric model, using analytics to "cover blind spots" while maintaining traditional scouting. This measured approach sacrifices immediate star power for long-term sustainability.

### Positioning against Kansas City requires perfect execution

The Chargers' offseason positions them as the **Chiefs' primary divisional challenger**, though history (0-5 in last 5 home games vs. KC) suggests closing that gap remains difficult. Their defensive superiority—retaining the league's #1 scoring defense—provides the foundation, while the enhanced rushing attack should keep Herbert upright and control games. Against improving Denver (Bo Nix development) and rebuilding Las Vegas (Pete Carroll arrival), the Chargers project as clear favorites.

The conservative approach reflects Hortiz's 26-year Baltimore pedigree: build through the draft, retain your own, and add veterans on prove-it deals. While perhaps lacking the splash of other contenders, this sustainable model positions the Chargers for consistent playoff contention. Success in 2025 hinges on Hampton's immediate impact, the offensive line gelling, and whether the defensive line depth can compensate for losing Ford. With $110.8 million in 2026 cap space and a young core locked up, the Chargers have built a foundation for sustained AFC West competition—even if dethroning Kansas City remains the ultimate challenge.
