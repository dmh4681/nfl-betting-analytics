# The Giants' great rebuild: How New York transformed its roster

The New York Giants executed a complete roster overhaul in the 2025 offseason, highlighted by replacing Daniel Jones with Russell Wilson and drafting quarterback Jaxson Dart while investing heavily in defense. After a franchise-worst 3-14 season, GM Joe Schoen secured approximately $46 million in cap space to reshape the team, though owner John Mara warned that both Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll have "run out of patience" and must show immediate improvement. The Giants' aggressive approach included trading up to draft their quarterback of the future, signing veteran leadership, and making strategic additions across the roster while managing $22.2 million in dead money from Jones's November 2024 release.

## 1. FREE AGENCY SIGNINGS

### Major Quarterback Acquisitions
The Giants completely rebuilt their quarterback room after cutting Daniel Jones. **Russell Wilson** signed a 1-year, $10.5 million fully guaranteed contract with extensive incentives that could push the total value to $21 million. The 36-year-old former Super Bowl champion brings veteran leadership and was expected to start in 2025. **Jameis Winston** joined on a more modest deal as the primary backup, bringing additional experience as a former #1 overall pick.

### Secondary Transformation  
The Giants made their biggest financial commitments to upgrading the secondary. **Jevon Holland** arrived from Miami on a 3-year, $45.3 million deal ($30.3M guaranteed), bringing playmaking ability despite coming off a career-low coverage grade. **Paulson Adebo** signed for 3 years, $54 million ($36M fully guaranteed) to serve as a shutdown corner opposite Deonte Banks, though he's recovering from a broken leg suffered late in 2024.

### Defensive Line Reinforcements
Multiple additions bolstered the defensive front. **Chauncey Golston** signed a 3-year, $19.5 million contract after recording a career-high 5.5 sacks with Dallas. **Roy Robertson-Harris** brought veteran experience on a 2-year, $9 million deal. Additional depth came from **Jeremiah Ledbetter** and several other rotational pieces.

### Notable Depth Signings
The Giants added veteran leadership and special teams help through **Chris Board** (2 years, up to $6M), who tied for 9th in the NFL with 8 special teams tackles. Offensive line depth came via **James Hudson III** (2 years, $12M) and **Stone Forsythe**. Wide receiver additions included **Zach Pascal** and **Lil'Jordan Humphrey**.

### Undrafted Free Agents
The Giants invested heavily in UDFAs, with **Da'Quan Felton** receiving $264,000 guaranteed - the 5th-richest UDFA deal league-wide. Other notable signings included **Jordan Bly** (son of Pro Bowler Dre Bly), **Beaux Collins** from Notre Dame, and defensive backs **T.J. Moore** and **R.J. Delancy III**.

## 2. FREE AGENCY LOSSES

### Division Rival Departures
The most painful losses went directly to Philadelphia. **Azeez Ojulari**, the 2021 second-round pick who recorded 22 career sacks despite injury issues, signed with the Eagles. **Adoree' Jackson**, the former first-round cornerback, also joined Philadelphia, significantly weakening the Giants' secondary before their free agency additions.

### Other Key Departures
**Isaiah Simmons** took his versatile linebacker/safety skills to Green Bay after playing just 17% of defensive snaps in 2024. **Drew Lock** signed with Seattle rather than returning as the backup quarterback. **Jason Pinnock** joined San Francisco, further depleting safety depth. The Giants also chose not to tender several restricted free agents including **Jonathan Sutherland** and **Divaad Wilson**.

### The Daniel Jones Era Ends
Released on November 22, 2024, Jones left behind a **$22.2 million dead cap charge** - the largest component of the Giants' $27.3 million in total dead money. After being demoted to fourth-string and practicing at scout team safety, Jones requested and received his release. He initially joined Minnesota's practice squad before eventually signing with another team.

## 3. TRADES

### Draft Day Blockbuster
The Giants' only significant trade came on draft day when they aggressively moved back into the first round. They sent their 2025 second-round pick (#34), third-round compensatory pick (#99), and a 2026 third-rounder to Houston for the #25 overall selection. This trade allowed them to select **quarterback Jaxson Dart** from Ole Miss with the valuable fifth-year option attached.

### Failed Trade Attempts
The Giants reportedly offered Tennessee the #3 overall pick, their 2026 first-rounder, and additional selections for the #1 overall pick, targeting quarterback Cam Ward. The Titans declined and selected Ward themselves, forcing the Giants to execute Plan B with the Dart trade.

## 4. 2025 NFL DRAFT

### Complete Draft Class
**Round 1, Pick #3: Abdul Carter, EDGE, Penn State** - The elite pass rusher with 12 sacks in 2024 was considered by many as the best overall talent in the draft. Expected to start immediately opposite Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux on a 4-year, $45.26 million fully guaranteed contract.

**Round 1, Pick #25: Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss** - Acquired via trade, the mobile quarterback passed for 4,279 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2024. He'll sit behind Wilson initially while developing as the franchise quarterback on a 4-year, $16.977 million fully guaranteed deal.

**Round 3, Pick #65: Darius Alexander, DT, Toledo** - Interior pass rusher with a 90.1 PFF grade provides immediate rotational help behind Dexter Lawrence.

**Round 4, Pick #105: Cam Skattebo, RB, Arizona State** - Physical runner who forced 100+ missed tackles brings a power element to complement Tyrone Tracy Jr.

**Round 5, Pick #154: Marcus Mbow, OL, Purdue** - Interior lineman with medical concerns provides guard competition.

**Round 7, Pick #219: Thomas Fidone II, TE, Nebraska** - Former 5-star recruit adds tight end depth despite injury history.

**Round 7, Pick #246: Korie Black, CB** - Ball skills specialist adds much-needed cornerback depth.

## 5. KEY RE-SIGNINGS

### Major Retentions
The Giants' biggest re-signing was **Darius Slayton** on a 3-year, $36 million extension. The 2019 fifth-round pick had been their leading receiver in four of the previous five seasons and remained their longest-tenured offensive player. **Jamie Gillan** received a 3-year deal worth up to $10.2 million, making him one of the highest-paid punters in the league.

### Depth Re-signings
**Greg Van Roten** returned on a one-year deal after not missing a single snap in 2024 (1,125 plays). **Chris Manhertz** (1 year, $1.4M), **Aaron Stinnie** (1 year, $1.3M), and **Casey Kreiter** all returned to provide veteran depth. **Tommy DeVito** received an exclusive rights tender worth approximately $1.03 million as the only quarterback familiar with the offensive system.

### No Extensions or Franchise Tag
The Giants chose not to use their franchise tag and didn't execute any major contract extensions for current players. Stars like Andrew Thomas, Dexter Lawrence, and Brian Burns had already received their big deals in previous years, though Burns' contract was restructured to create $16.8 million in cap space.

## 6. COACHING/FRONT OFFICE CHANGES

### Leadership on the Hot Seat
**Brian Daboll retained but warned** - Despite the 3-14 disaster, owner John Mara announced on January 6, 2025, that Daboll would return. However, Mara publicly stated he's "run out of patience" and "it better not take too long" for improvement. Daboll's 12-31-1 record since their 7-2 start in 2022 puts him squarely on the hot seat for 2025.

**Joe Schoen also returns under pressure** - The GM received praise for his 2024 draft class and the Brian Burns trade, but like Daboll, faces a make-or-break 2025 season. His philosophy focuses on "finding the best player available that can help us win games in '25."

### Coordinator Changes
**Mike Kafka retained as OC** but with reduced responsibilities after Daboll took over play-calling during 2024. **Shane Bowen returns as DC** despite heavy criticism from Mara about the defense ranking 31st in interceptions. **Michael Ghobrial hired** as the new special teams coordinator, replacing the fired Thomas McGaughey.

### Strategic Direction
The organization attempted to balance rebuilding with competing, prioritizing the quarterback position while maintaining defensive talent. Mara's demand for immediate improvement clashes somewhat with the longer-term rebuild strategy, creating tension that will define the 2025 season.

## 7. CONTEXT AND ANALYSIS

### Salary Cap Gymnastics
The Giants entered the offseason with approximately $46 million in cap space after the NFL salary cap rose to $279.2 million. However, they carried $27.3 million in dead money (7th-most in the NFL), with $22.2 million from Jones alone. After their signings, they have roughly $5.5 million remaining but can create up to $50 million more through restructures of Burns, Lawrence, and Thomas.

### From Bad to Worse to Better?
The 2024 season featured a franchise-record 10-game losing streak, only one home victory, and first-place finishes in nothing except draft position. Major injuries to Dexter Lawrence (dislocated elbow), Andrew Thomas (foot), and rookie tight end Theo Johnson (Lisfranc) compounded the misery. The team hasn't made the playoffs in consecutive seasons and has reached the postseason just twice since 2012.

### Addressing Team Needs
**Successfully addressed**: Quarterback (complete overhaul), pass rush (Abdul Carter), secondary (Holland/Adebo), defensive line depth, and running back depth (Skattebo).

**Still lacking**: A reliable #2 receiver opposite Malik Nabers, sufficient cornerback depth beyond the Adebo addition, offensive line depth at tackle, and tight end depth given Johnson's injury history.

### The Quarterback Question Answered
The Daniel Jones era ended ignominiously with his November release after being demoted to fourth-string. The Giants' three-pronged approach - Wilson as the 2025 bridge, Winston as insurance, and Dart as the future - represents their clearest quarterback plan in years. Most analysts expect Dart to see playing time by mid-2025 if the team struggles early.

### Rebuild or Compete?
Despite Mara's impatience, the Giants executed a clear rebuild strategy. They prioritized draft capital and young talent over expensive veteran signings, built through the draft rather than free agency splashes, and established a clear timeline with 2025 as a transition year, 2026 for Dart to take over, and 2027+ as their competitive window. The success of this approach will determine whether Daboll and Schoen survive beyond 2025.

The Giants' 2025 offseason represents their most comprehensive roster overhaul in years. While immediate success seems unlikely given the tough schedule and roster limitations, they've finally established a coherent long-term vision centered on developing Jaxson Dart behind veteran quarterbacks while building an elite defense anchored by Carter, Lawrence, and Burns. Whether ownership's patience lasts long enough for this plan to bear fruit remains the crucial question hanging over the franchise.
