# Dallas Cowboys 2025 offseason: Jerry Jones' calculated response to playoff miss

After a disastrous 7-10 season that ended their three-year streak of 12-win campaigns, the Dallas Cowboys underwent significant changes in 2025, starting with the dismissal of Mike McCarthy and promoting Brian Schottenheimer to head coach. Despite initial promises of a more aggressive approach, Jerry Jones ultimately maintained the Cowboys' traditional conservative free agency strategy while making strategic additions through trades and the draft.

## 1. FREE AGENCY SIGNINGS

### External Free Agent Signings (4 players)

The Cowboys signed just four external free agents for approximately $15-20 million total:

**Javonte Williams (RB)** - Former Denver Broncos back signed to a 1-year, $3.5 million deal ($3M base, $500K incentives). Williams brings pass-catching ability to complement the draft picks, having totaled 1,287 yards from scrimmage over his last two seasons in Denver.

**Miles Sanders (RB)** - The former Carolina Panthers back signed a 1-year deal after a career-low 205 rushing yards in 2024. Sanders adds veteran depth with a different running style than Williams.

**Solomon Thomas (DT)** - The Dallas-area native (Coppell, Texas) signed a 2-year, $8 million maximum value contract. Thomas reunites with DL coach Aaron Whitecotton after recording 8.5 sacks and 14 TFLs in three seasons with the Jets.

**Jack Sanborn (LB)** - The former Chicago Bears linebacker signed a 1-year deal, bringing familiarity with new DC Matt Eberflus' system after playing three seasons under him in Chicago.

### Practice Squad/Futures Signings

Notable additions included **Payton Turner (DE)** on a 1-year deal under $3 million, **Parris Campbell (WR)** returning on a 1-year deal, **Dante Fowler (DE)** re-signed after his Washington stint, and offensive linemen **Robert Jones** (under $5M) and **Saahdiq Charles** who came out of retirement.

### Undrafted Free Agents (9 players)

The highest-paid UDFA was **Alijah Clark (DB, Syracuse)** with $234,000 guaranteed salary plus a $25,000 bonus. Other notable UDFAs include **Traeshon Holden (WR, Oregon)**, **Josh Kelly (WR, Texas Tech)** who had 89 catches for 1,023 yards in 2024, and **Zion Childress (CB, Kentucky)** who started 25 straight games at nickel.

## 2. FREE AGENCY LOSSES

### Major Departures

**DeMarcus Lawrence (DE) → Seattle Seahawks** - The Cowboys' longest-tenured player and 4x Pro Bowler signed a 3-year, $42 million deal ($18M guaranteed) with Seattle. Lawrence recorded 61.5 sacks in 11 seasons with Dallas but was limited to 4 games in 2024 due to foot injury.

**Jourdan Lewis (CB) → Jacksonville Jaguars** - The 8-year Cowboys veteran signed a 3-year, $30 million contract ($20M guaranteed) to become the NFL's highest-paid nickel corner at $10M AAV. Lewis had a career-high 71 tackles in 2024 and was a major locker room leader.

**Rico Dowdle (RB) → Carolina Panthers** - The first UDFA in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000+ yards signed a 1-year, $2.75 million guaranteed deal with incentives up to $6.25M. Dowdle rushed for 1,079 yards in 2024 and caught 39 passes for 249 yards.

**Chauncey Golston (DE) → New York Giants** - After recording career-highs of 56 tackles and 5.5 sacks filling in for injured Lawrence, Golston departed for division rival New York.

**Other Notable Losses**: **Brandin Cooks (WR)** reunited with New Orleans after the Cowboys added multiple receivers. **Cooper Rush (QB)** signed with Baltimore. **Chuma Edoga (OT)** followed Lewis to Jacksonville.

### Releases/Cuts

The Cowboys made several post-June 1 cuts for cap savings, with **Zack Martin's retirement** creating $9.4 million in dead cap space.

## 3. TRADES

The Cowboys executed four significant trades to address immediate needs:

**George Pickens (WR) from Pittsburgh Steelers** - The marquee acquisition came on May 7, 2025, with Dallas sending a 2026 3rd round pick and 2027 5th round pick for Pickens and a 2027 6th rounder. The 24-year-old had 59 catches for 900 yards in 2024. Stephen Jones compared him to "88 club member Dez Bryant."

**Kenneth Murray Jr. (LB) from Tennessee Titans** - Acquired March 12 for a 2025 6th round pick (#188), Dallas received Murray and a 7th rounder (#239). The former 1st round pick had 95 tackles and 3.5 sacks in 2024 and inherited one year remaining on his $15.5M deal.

**Joe Milton III (QB) from New England Patriots** - The Cowboys sent a 2025 5th round compensatory pick (#171) for Milton and a 7th rounder (#217) in April. The Dallas-area native will compete with Will Grier for the backup role.

**Kaiir Elam (CB) from Buffalo Bills** - Dallas sent a 2025 5th round pick and 2026 7th for Elam and a 2025 6th rounder on March 12. The former 1st round pick provides depth with Trevon Diggs recovering from knee surgery.

## 4. 2025 NFL DRAFT

The Cowboys made 9 total selections after entering with 10 picks (4 compensatory):

**Round 1, Pick 12: Tyler Booker, G, Alabama** - Direct replacement for retired Zack Martin at right guard, expected immediate starter.

**Round 2, Pick 44: Donovan Ezeiruaku, EDGE, Boston College** - Led ACC with 16.5 sacks in 2024, replacing DeMarcus Lawrence's pass rush production.

**Round 3, Pick 76: Shavon Revel Jr., CB, East Carolina** - 6'3" press-man corner with 32⅝" arms, recovering from torn ACL.

**Round 5, Pick 149: Jaydon Blue, RB, Texas** - Speed back with 4.38 40-yard dash, played behind Bijan Robinson.

**Round 5, Pick 152: Shemar James, LB, Florida** - Cowboys traded up (picks 174 + 204 to Arizona) for versatile linebacker.

**Round 6, Pick 204: Ajani Cornelius, OT, Oregon** - Versatile lineman who can play tackle or guard.

**Round 7 (3 picks)**: **Jay Toia, DT, UCLA** (#217) - 341-pound run-stopper; **Phil Mafah, RB, Clemson** (#239) - Power runner to complement Blue; **Tommy Akingbesote, DT, Maryland** (#247) - Additional DT depth.

### Draft Trades

The Cowboys traded up once during the draft, sending picks 174 and 204 to Arizona for pick 152 to select Shemar James. Pre-draft trades affecting their picks included sending a 4th rounder to Carolina for Jonathan Mingo in 2024.

### Projected Impact

Tyler Booker and Donovan Ezeiruaku are expected immediate starters. Shavon Revel Jr. could start opposite DaRon Bland if healthy, with Diggs recovering from surgery. Jay Toia surprisingly worked with the first team in OTAs due to run defense needs.

## 5. KEY RE-SIGNINGS

**Osa Odighizuwa (DT)** - The Cowboys' biggest internal signing was a 4-year, $80 million extension with significant guarantees, making him a cornerstone of Matt Eberflus' defense.

**Markquese Bell (S)** - Avoided restricted free agency with a 3-year, $12 million extension. The versatile defender had 102 tackles playing a hybrid LB/S role in 2023.

**Dante Fowler Jr. (DE)** - After recording 10.5 sacks with Washington in 2024, Fowler returned on a 1-year, $6 million base deal ($8M max with incentives, $5M guaranteed).

**Other Extensions**: **KaVontae Turpin (WR/KR)** received a 3-year extension. **C.J. Goodwin (S)** re-signed for special teams. **Bryan Anger (P)** got a 2-year extension. **Trevon Sieg (LS)** signed a 3-year, $4.45 million deal.

## 6. COACHING/FRONT OFFICE CHANGES

### Head Coach Change

**Mike McCarthy was fired** on January 14, 2025, after his contract expired. McCarthy went 49-35 in five regular seasons but just 1-3 in playoffs. Jerry Jones announced January 13 that McCarthy would not return.

**Brian Schottenheimer** was promoted from offensive coordinator to become the franchise's 10th head coach on a 4-year deal. The first-time NFL head coach will continue calling plays.

### Coordinator Overhaul

**Matt Eberflus** was hired as defensive coordinator, returning to Dallas where he was linebackers coach from 2011-2017. He replaces **Mike Zimmer**, who reportedly retired.

**Klayton Adams** was promoted to offensive coordinator, though Schottenheimer retains play-calling duties. **Nick Sorensen** was hired as special teams coordinator, replacing **John "Bones" Fassel**.

### Staff Changes

New additions include **Conor Riley** (OL coach from Kansas State), **Junior Adams** (WR coach from Oregon), and **Bryan Bing** (assistant DL coach). **Al Harris** left to join the Bears as DBs coach.

### Front Office

**Will McClay** signed a 5-year extension as VP of Player Personnel, maintaining continuity in the scouting department.

## 7. CONTEXT

### Salary Cap Situation

The Cowboys entered 2025 with the NFL salary cap at a record $279.2 million (up $23.8M). They restructured **Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb** contracts to create **$56.6 million in cap space**, leaving them with **$38.5 million available** after early moves.

Dead money includes $9.4 million from Zack Martin's retirement and over $7 million if DeMarcus Lawrence isn't re-signed. **Micah Parsons extension talks are ongoing**, which could free additional space from his $21.4M fifth-year option.

### Major 2024 Injuries Affecting 2025

**Dak Prescott** suffered a partial hamstring avulsion in Week 9, had surgery November 13, but is expected ready for 2025. **Trevon Diggs** underwent chondral tissue graft surgery in January and **may miss the start of 2025**, potentially not returning until mid-season. **DeMarvion Overshown** tore his ACL, MCL, and PCL in Week 14, targeting a Week 13 return vs. Chiefs on Thanksgiving.

The team lost roughly 46% of salary cap to injuries during the 2024 season, with Parsons, Martin, Cooks, and Lawrence all missing significant time.

### Biggest Needs Addressed/Unaddressed

**Addressed**: Wide receiver (Pickens trade), offensive line (Booker draft pick), pass rush (Ezeiruaku, Fowler), running back (Williams, Sanders, Blue, Mafah), cornerback depth (Elam, Revel).

**Unaddressed**: Safety depth remains thin. Linebacker depth concerns with Overshown's injury. Interior defensive line still questionable despite Thomas signing and late-round picks.

### Jerry Jones' Approach

Despite initial suggestions from Stephen Jones about being "selectively aggressive," Jerry ultimately maintained the Cowboys' conservative approach: *"I don't think aggressive is the right word... I'm not looking at free agency as a place to fill voids."*

On rebuilding vs. competing: *"The decisions I'm making are not based on rebuilding. They're based on competing and competing now... I think I paid Dak more than anybody has ever been paid in the NFL. That's now. That's not the future."*

The 2025 offseason reflects a measured response to the playoff miss - addressing clear needs through strategic trades and the draft while avoiding major free agency splashes. The coaching overhaul represents the biggest change, with Schottenheimer tasked with maximizing a roster that Jones believes can still compete immediately.
