# Philadelphia Eagles 2025 offseason roster reconstruction

The Philadelphia Eagles entered the 2025 offseason as Super Bowl LIX champions but faced critical decisions about maintaining their championship roster. After prioritizing offensive continuity through major extensions, the Eagles lost significant defensive talent while betting on youth and value signings to defend their title.

## Free agents signed bring depth over star power

The Eagles' free agency approach reflected fiscal discipline, signing 12 players exclusively to one-year deals totaling approximately $15-16 million in guaranteed money. **Azeez Ojulari** emerged as their marquee signing, earning a fully guaranteed $3 million contract to replace departed pass rusher Josh Sweat. The former Giants edge rusher produced 6 sacks in 11 games during 2024 despite limited snaps behind Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux.

Joshua Uche, acquired for $1.92 million after bouncing between New England and Kansas City, brings proven pass rush upside after recording 11.5 sacks in 2022. His 16.7% pressure rate since 2022 ranks sixth among edge rushers, though he managed only 2 sacks across 13 games in 2024 while playing just 22% of defensive snaps.

**Adoree' Jackson** addresses cornerback depth following Darius Slay's release, signing for $1.755 million after starting 5 of 14 games for the Giants. His 69.0 PFF grade ranked 58th among 223 qualifying cornerbacks, allowing 20 completions on 38 targets for 262 yards and 2 touchdowns.

The remaining signings focused on special teams and depth, including return specialist Avery Williams ($1.225 million) who averaged 27.2 yards per kickoff return, and long snapper Charley Hughlett ($1.422 million) to replace eight-year veteran Rick Lovato. Running back A.J. Dillon joined on a minimum deal despite missing all of 2024 with a neck injury, while tight ends Harrison Bryant and Kylen Granson provide insurance if Dallas Goedert is traded.

## Defensive exodus creates massive roster turnover

The Eagles' most painful departure came via **Josh Sweat's** four-year, $76.4 million deal with Arizona. The team-leading pass rusher recorded 8 sacks during the regular season and added 2.5 more in the Super Bowl, playing 59% of defensive snaps as the primary edge threat. His departure rates a 9/10 importance given his proven playoff production and the difficulty of replacing established pass rushers.

**Milton Williams** capitalized on his breakout season to secure a four-year, $104 million contract from New England, making him the NFL's third-highest paid defensive tackle. His 5 sacks and 54 pressures from 48% snap share included a crucial strip-sack of Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl, earning an 8/10 importance rating despite playing alongside All-Pro Jalen Carter.

Special teams ace Oren Burks parlayed his playoff heroics into a two-year, $5 million deal with Cincinnati. After playing just 14% of defensive snaps during the regular season, injuries forced him into the starting lineup for three playoff games where he recorded 25 tackles, validating his 6/10 importance rating.

The Eagles also lost rotational pieces including running back Kenneth Gainwell (Steelers, $1.79 million), cornerback Avonte Maddox (Lions), and swing tackle Fred Johnson (Jaguars). Safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson departed via trade to Houston for guard Kenyon Green and a 2026 fifth-round pick, removing the defense's emotional leader who intercepted 6 passes in 2024.

## Draft emphasizes defensive rebuild with 10 selections

Philadelphia's draft strategy directly addressed defensive departures, starting with **Jihaad Campbell** at pick 31 after trading up from 32. The Alabama linebacker recorded team-highs of 117 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss, and 5 sacks while earning First-Team All-SEC honors. His versatility to play off-ball linebacker or edge rusher fits perfectly in Vic Fangio's multiple scheme.

Second-round safety **Andrew Mukuba** replaces Gardner-Johnson after leading the SEC with 5 interceptions at Texas. The four-year starter brings veteran presence and ball skills to a young secondary, though his 6'0", 186-pound frame raises durability concerns.

Fourth-round defensive tackle **Ty Robinson** fills Milton Williams' void after leading Nebraska with 12 tackles for loss and 7 sacks. The 6'6", 310-pound lineman ran a 4.83 forty-yard dash, showcasing exceptional first-step quickness despite shorter arms limiting his reach.

Later selections added depth across the roster, including linebackers Smael Mondon Jr. (Georgia) and cornerback Mac McWilliams (UCF) in the fifth round. Sixth-round quarterback Kyle McCord, who led FBS with 4,779 passing yards at Syracuse, provides developmental depth behind Jalen Hurts and Tanner McKee. The Eagles concluded by selecting Virginia Tech edge rusher Antwaun Powell-Ryland, who recorded 16 sacks in 2024.

## Trades reshape roster while accumulating assets

The Eagles executed multiple significant trades, beginning with **Kenny Pickett's** departure to Cleveland for a fifth-round pick and quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Gardner-Johnson's trade to Houston brought back guard Kenyon Green, addressing interior line depth while creating $2.4 million in cap savings.

Most notably, the Eagles absorbed $9.05 million in dead money to trade disappointing free agent acquisition Bryce Huff to San Francisco for a Day 3 pick. Huff managed just 2.5 sacks after signing a three-year, $51 million deal in 2024, making him an expensive mistake.

Draft day saw extensive maneuvering, with the Eagles executing five trades to maximize value. They moved up one spot for Campbell, then systematically traded down to accumulate picks, ultimately selecting 10 players after entering with 8 selections.

## Retirements and releases mark end of an era

**Brandon Graham's** retirement after 15 seasons removed the franchise's emotional leader and third all-time sack leader (76.5). The two-time Super Bowl champion played through a torn triceps to contribute in Super Bowl LIX, concluding a Hall of Fame-worthy career that included the iconic strip-sack of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII.

Cornerbacks **Darius Slay** and **James Bradberry** received post-June 1 designations, creating $6.4 million in combined cap savings while generating $33.56 million in total dead money. Slay's departure after five Pro Bowl-caliber seasons signals the complete transition to young cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean.

## Extensions lock in championship core

The Eagles prioritized retaining offensive cornerstones through major extensions. **Saquon Barkley's** two-year, $41.2 million deal made him the NFL's highest-paid running back after his historic 2,000-yard season. Center **Cam Jurgens** earned a four-year, $68 million extension following his Pro Bowl rookie campaign replacing Jason Kelce.

Linebacker **Zack Baun's** three-year, $51 million extension rewarded his Defensive Player of the Year finalist season (151 tackles, 5 forced fumbles, 3.5 sacks). Right tackle Lane Johnson extended through 2027, maintaining continuity on the championship offensive line.

## Championship defense faces significant challenges

The Eagles' offseason reflected calculated risk-taking, investing $193.9 million in offensive talent while their defense ranks 31st in cash spending. Losing established pass rushers Sweat and Williams while betting on injury-prone one-year signings creates substantial uncertainty.

Philadelphia's success defending their title depends on young defensive players rapidly developing. Rookies Mitchell, DeJean, Campbell, and Mukuba must immediately contribute at starting levels, while second-year players Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt need breakout seasons to replace departed pass rush production.

The strategy prioritizes maintaining an elite offense around MVP candidate Jalen Hurts while gambling that defensive coordinator Vic Fangio can maximize young talent. With $33.56 million in dead money limiting flexibility, the Eagles have minimal margin for error in their youth movement. Their championship defense hinges on whether low-cost veterans and draft picks can adequately replace proven playoff performers.
