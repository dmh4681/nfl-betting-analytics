# Miami Dolphins' 2025 offseason transformation

The Miami Dolphins entered the 2025 offseason at a crossroads after another disappointing 8-9 season, missing the playoffs despite high expectations. Owner Stephen Ross chose stability over upheaval, retaining both GM Chris Grier and head coach Mike McDaniel while warning that "continuity in leadership is not to be confused with acceptance that status quo is good enough." The front office responded with a clear philosophical shift toward building in the trenches and addressing the offensive line protection that failed Tua Tagovailoa in 2024.

## 1. FREE AGENCY SIGNINGS

The Dolphins made targeted additions focusing heavily on offensive line protection and defensive depth.

### Major Signings:
**Offensive Line** - The crown jewel of their free agency was **James Daniels (G)** on a 3-year, $24 million deal from the Chicago Bears. This directly addresses their critical need to protect Tua Tagovailoa. They also added **Larry Borom (OL)** from Chicago as versatile backup depth.

**Quarterbacks** - **Zach Wilson** signed a 1-year deal from Denver to serve as Tua's primary backup, addressing a glaring weakness from 2024 when they cycled through Skylar Thompson, Tim Boyle, and Tyler Huntley during Tua's injury absence.

**Wide Receivers** - **Nick Westbrook-Ikhine** joined on a 2-year, $6.5 million deal ($3.2M guaranteed) from Tennessee, bringing a more physical presence to complement speedsters Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle.

**Running Backs** - **Alexander Mattison** signed a 1-year deal from Las Vegas to provide a physical short-yardage option at 220 pounds.

**Tight Ends** - **Pharaoh Brown** joined from Houston as a blocking specialist to help the revamped offensive line.

**Linebackers** - The team added **K.J. Britt** (1-year from Tampa Bay) and **Willie Gay Jr.** (1-year from Kansas City) for depth and run-stopping ability. They also re-signed **Tyrel Dodson** to a 2-year, $8.25 million deal after he led the team with 3 interceptions.

**Secondary** - Notable additions include **Ashtyn Davis (S)** on a 1-year, $2.5 million deal from the Jets and **Ifeatu Melifonwu (S)** on a 1-year, $4 million deal from Detroit to help replace Jevon Holland. **Artie Burns (CB)** returns to his hometown on a 1-year deal from Seattle, while **Kendall Sheffield (CB)** adds depth.

**Special Teams** - Perhaps the most intriguing signing was **Ryan Stonehouse (P)** from Tennessee, who holds the NFL record for punting average at 53.1 yards per punt. **Joe Cardona (LS)** was also signed from New England.

### Practice Squad/UDFA Additions:
The Dolphins signed 16 undrafted free agents, with notable additions including **Andrew Armstrong (WR)** from Arkansas (6'4" red zone target), **Eugene Asante (LB)** from Auburn, **Josh Priebe (G)** from Michigan for offensive line depth, and **Theo Wease (WR)** from Missouri.

### Key Re-signings:
- **Liam Eichenberg (OG)** - 1-year deal
- **Jackson Carman (OT)** - Tackle depth
- **Dee Eskridge (WR)** - Special teams value
- **Quinton Bell (LB)**, **Elijah Campbell (S)**, **Benito Jones (DT)** - Depth pieces retained

## 2. FREE AGENCY LOSSES

The Dolphins lost several key contributors, creating both cap space and roster holes.

### Major Departures:
**Jevon Holland (S)** - Their starting safety signed a 3-year, $45 million deal with the New York Giants, representing a significant loss in the secondary despite his down 2024 season.

**Calais Campbell (DL)** - The veteran leader joined Arizona after starting all 17 games for Miami in 2024. His leadership and 615 defensive snaps (58% of defensive plays) will be difficult to replace.

**Robert Jones (OG)** - The starting left guard signed with Dallas, creating the hole that James Daniels was brought in to fill.

**Emmanuel Ogbah (LB/DE)** - After recording 5.0 sacks filling in for injured Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips, he signed a 1-year deal worth up to $5 million with Jacksonville.

**Anthony Walker Jr. (LB)** - Signed with Tampa Bay (essentially swapped for K.J. Britt).

**Da'Shawn Hand (DT)** - Signed with the Chargers after playing 563 snaps on the defensive line.

**Siran Neal (CB)** - Joined San Francisco after contributing on special teams and as a nickel corner.

### Salary Cap Casualties:
- **Kendall Fuller (CB)** - Released for cap savings after starting opposite Jalen Ramsey
- **Raheem Mostert (RB)** - Released then signed with Las Vegas
- **Durham Smythe (TE)** - Released, signed with Chicago on a 1-year deal

### Retirement:
**Terron Armstead (OT)** - The starting left tackle retired after his salary was reduced to league minimum, creating a massive hole at the most important offensive line position.

## 3. TRADES

The Dolphins were relatively quiet in the trade market, with their main move coming on draft day.

### 2025 Draft Day Trade (April 25):
**Traded to Las Vegas:** 
- 2nd round pick (#48)
- 3rd round pick (#98) 
- 4th round pick (#135)

**Received from Las Vegas:** 
- 2nd round pick (#37)
- 5th round pick (#143)

The Dolphins moved up 11 spots to select **Jonah Savaiinaea (OG)** from Arizona, showing their commitment to fixing the offensive line by sacrificing significant draft capital.

### Pending Trade:
**Jalen Ramsey** - The team and player have mutually agreed to explore trade options after June 1 for salary cap benefits. A post-June 1 trade would save $10.8 million in 2025 cap space versus a $12.6 million penalty if traded before. Multiple teams including the Raiders, Rams, Chargers, and Cardinals have expressed interest.

### Historical Trade Compensation:
The Dolphins also received a 5th round pick (#155) from Denver as part of the original Bradley Chubb trade and a 7th round pick (#224) from Chicago from the Chase Claypool trade.

## 4. 2025 NFL DRAFT

The Dolphins focused heavily on the trenches, with 4 of their 8 picks going to offensive or defensive linemen.

**Round 1, Pick 13:** **Kenneth Grant (DT, Michigan)** - 6'4", 331 lbs. Expected immediate starter at nose tackle to replace Christian Wilkins. Recorded 6.5 sacks at Michigan despite his size, showing surprising pass-rush upside.

**Round 2, Pick 37 (via trade):** **Jonah Savaiinaea (OG, Arizona)** - 6'4", 324 lbs. Versatile lineman who played multiple positions in college, expected to compete for immediate starting role at guard.

**Round 5, Pick 143 (from LV):** **Jordan Phillips (DT, Maryland)** - 6'2", 312 lbs. Rotational defensive tackle.

**Round 5, Pick 150:** **Jason Marshall Jr. (CB, Florida)** - 6'0", 195 lbs. Developmental corner and local product from Miami Palmetto HS.

**Round 5, Pick 155:** **Dante Trader Jr. (S, Maryland)** - Two-sport athlete adding secondary depth and special teams value.

**Round 6, Pick 179:** **Ollie Gordon II (RB, Oklahoma State)** - 6'2", 220 lbs. Physical runner for short-yardage situations, addressing the team's struggles in goal-line scenarios.

**Round 7, Pick 231:** **Quinn Ewers (QB, Texas)** - Developmental quarterback project behind Tagovailoa and Wilson.

**Round 7, Pick 253:** **Zeek Biggers (DT, Georgia Tech)** - 6'6", 321 lbs. Massive defensive tackle for depth and development.

**Draft Analysis:** The focus on size and physicality (combined weight of first two picks: 655+ pounds) represents a clear philosophical shift. Mel Kiper gave the draft a C+ grade, praising early picks but questioning mid-round value.

## 5. KEY RE-SIGNINGS

### Tua Tagovailoa Contract Status:
Tua signed a **4-year, $212.4 million extension in summer 2024** with **$167 million guaranteed**, making him the 3rd highest-paid QB at the time. His 2025 details include a $25 million base salary, $25 million signing bonus, and **$39.2 million cap hit**. The contract runs through 2028, showing the team's ultimate commitment despite his injury history (missed 14 games in first 4 seasons, including 9 due to concussions).

Since Mike McDaniel's arrival in 2022, Tua ranks 2nd in NFL in passer rating (102.9) and yards per attempt (8.5). The team averages **27.6 PPG with Tua versus 16.3 PPG without him**, highlighting his critical importance.

### Other Key Extensions/Re-signings:
**Tyrel Dodson (LB)** - 2-year, $8.25 million deal after leading team with 3 interceptions despite limited starts.

**Liam Eichenberg (OL)** - 1-year deal for continuity and versatility on the offensive line.

**Jackson Carman (OT)** - Re-signed for tackle depth after Armstead's retirement.

Multiple depth pieces were retained including Dee Eskridge (WR), Benito Jones (DT), Quinton Bell (LB), and Elijah Campbell (S).

## 7. CONTEXT NOTES

### 2024 Season Recap:
The Dolphins finished 8-9 (2nd in AFC East), missing the playoffs for the first time since 2021. They were eliminated in Week 18 with a -19 point differential (345 scored, 364 allowed).

**Key Issues:**
- **Tua's Injuries:** Suffered 3rd diagnosed concussion in Week 2 vs. Buffalo, missed 6 starts. Team went 1-3 without him, scoring only 40 total points over 4 games he missed completely.
- **Offensive Line Collapse:** GM Grier admitted being wrong after saying media was more "worried than we are" about OL. Team used 5 different tackle combinations by Week 15.
- **Quarterback Carousel:** Cycled through Skylar Thompson, Tim Boyle, and Tyler Huntley as backups.

**Bright Spot:** Defense improved to top-10 under Anthony Weaver despite injuries to Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips.

### Salary Cap Situation:
**Current Status:** $13.7-28.4 million in cap space after entering offseason ~$12 million over

**Major Cap Moves:**
- Bradley Chubb restructure saved $16.3 million (new cap hit: $12.4M vs. $28.7M)
- Releases of Mostert, Smythe, Fuller created additional space
- Can create nearly $30 million more through additional restructures

**Top 2025 Cap Hits:**
1. Tua Tagovailoa - $39.2 million
2. Tyreek Hill - $27.7 million  
3. Jalen Ramsey - $16.7 million (pending trade)
4. Austin Jackson - $13.5 million
5. Jaelan Phillips - $13.3 million

### Biggest Needs Addressed vs. Unaddressed:

**Successfully Addressed:**
- Offensive line (Daniels, Savaiinaea, Borom signings plus draft focus)
- Backup QB (Zach Wilson provides experienced option)
- Defensive line depth (Kenneth Grant plus multiple draft picks)
- Punter upgrade (Ryan Stonehouse)

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Left tackle after Armstead retirement remains massive question mark
- Cornerback depth following Fuller release and potential Ramsey trade
- Edge rusher health with Chubb/Phillips injury histories
- Tua's long-term durability given concussion history

### Organizational Philosophy:
The Dolphins are firmly in "win-now" mode rather than rebuilding. The focus on offensive line and defensive trenches represents a philosophical shift from "finesse" to physicality after criticism of being "soft" in crucial moments. GM Grier acknowledged the team's philosophical change, stating they needed to get "bigger and more physical" after being pushed around by playoff-caliber teams.

With the NFL's longest active playoff win drought (since 2000), 2025 is viewed as a critical season. McDaniel likely needs a playoff appearance and competitive showing to avoid "Black Monday," while Grier's long-term security depends on finally breaking through after years of "almost" seasons. The team has the talent to compete with Tua, Hill, Waddle, and an improved defense, but health and consistency against quality opponents remain the ultimate tests.
