# Rams rebuild around Stafford with strategic gambles

The Los Angeles Rams transformed their roster through calculated risk-taking in the 2025 offseason, replacing Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp with future Hall of Famer Davante Adams while positioning themselves for both immediate contention and long-term flexibility. The defending NFC West champions executed **58 total transactions** including the blockbuster Adams signing, a franchise-altering draft trade that netted them a 2026 first-round pick, and strategic defensive upgrades that address their fatal 2024 flaw. With Matthew Stafford secured through a restructured deal and **$75 million in projected 2026 cap space**, GM Les Snead has engineered a remarkable pivot from cap-constrained to asset-rich while maintaining championship aspirations in what experts predict will be the NFL's most competitive division race.

## Trading past glory for future firepower

The Rams' most dramatic move came in March when they released Cooper Kupp after unsuccessful trade attempts, absorbing **$22.3 million in dead money** but clearing the path for their masterstroke: signing Davante Adams to a 2-year, $46 million deal. The 31-year-old Adams, who caught 103 passes for 1,509 yards in 2023, joins 24-year-old sensation Puka Nacua to form arguably the NFL's most dangerous receiving tandem. This calculated gamble—swapping an injury-prone franchise icon for a proven producer—exemplifies the Rams' new philosophy of maintaining competitiveness while building sustainability.

The offensive reconstruction extended beyond the headline moves. The Rams secured left tackle **Alaric Jackson** with a 3-year, $57.75 million extension, ensuring Stafford's blindside protection, and brought back center Coleman Shelton after his one-year Chicago detour. They also retained speedy receiver Tutu Atwell on a fully guaranteed $10 million deal and kept veteran backup Jimmy Garoppolo with a restructured contract worth up to $13.5 million. The offensive line shuffle included trading disappointing guard Jonah Jackson to Chicago for a sixth-round pick, saving $17.5 million while admitting a rare free agency miss.

## Defense transforms from liability to strength

After allowing 100-plus rushing yards in **15 of 21 games** including playoffs in 2024, the Rams aggressively addressed their Achilles' heel by signing nose tackle **Poona Ford** to a 3-year, $29.6 million deal. Ford, who ranked fifth among all interior defenders and sixth in run defense according to PFF in 2024, immediately upgrades a unit that hemorrhaged yards up the middle. The defensive reinforcement continued through the draft, where the Rams selected Ohio State defensive tackle Ty Hamilton in the fifth round and Michigan edge rusher Josaiah Stewart in the third round, adding youth and depth to complement their emerging stars.

The linebacker corps underwent complete reconstruction after losing starters Christian Rozeboom and Jake Hummel to free agency. The Rams signed veteran Nate Landman from Atlanta and drafted Ole Miss captain Chris "Pooh" Paul Jr., who remarkably didn't allow a touchdown in **665 coverage snaps** during his college career. These moves, combined with the retention of cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, signal a commitment to defensive improvement that matches their offensive investments.

## Draft brilliance trades present for future flexibility

In perhaps their shrewdest move, the Rams traded their 26th overall pick to Atlanta for the Falcons' 2025 second-rounder and, crucially, their **2026 first-round selection**. This masterful trade provides insurance for the post-Stafford era while still allowing them to address immediate needs. With their acquired second-round pick, they selected Oregon tight end **Terrance Ferguson**, filling a critical void after the Rams' tight ends produced a league-worst 459 receiving yards in 2024.

The draft philosophy emphasized immediate contributors over developmental projects. Auburn running back **Jarquez Hunter** (4th round) brings 4.4 speed and SEC-leading yards after contact to complement workhorse Kyren Williams. The Rams traded up twice more to secure their targets, showing conviction in their evaluations while maintaining future flexibility. Their six total selections addressed every major need: tight end, linebacker, pass rush, and offensive skill positions.

## Coaching continuity masks strategic evolution

While maintaining coordinator stability with Mike LaFleur (offense) and Chris Shula (defense) returning, the Rams made calculated additions to enhance their systems. The hiring of **Drew Wilkins** as pass rush coordinator brings Ravens-style blitz packages to maximize young edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young. Veteran offensive assistant **Alex Van Pelt**, fresh off developing Drake Maye in New England, provides insurance and expertise for potential quarterback transitions.

The most significant loss came when tight ends coach **Nick Caley** departed for Houston's offensive coordinator position, taking his innovative passing concepts that helped the Rams rank 10th in passing offense despite injuries. The Rams promoted 34-year-old **Nathan Scheelhaase** to pass game coordinator, with Sean McVay calling him a "stud" who will be "involved in all parts of the game plan." This internal promotion maintains system continuity while injecting fresh ideas from a coach who drew OC interest from multiple teams.

## Financial chess positions Rams for sustained success

Operating with just **$19.6 million** in current cap space (before draft signings), the Rams have transformed their financial outlook through strategic restructuring and calculated releases. Stafford's new deal actually lowered his 2025 cap hit by $8.7 million despite guaranteeing him $40 million for 2026 if he remains on the roster. The team carries **$50.8 million in dead money**—seventh-most in the NFL—but has positioned itself for dramatic improvement with $75 million in projected 2026 cap space.

The looming challenge involves extending their impressive young core. Running back **Kyren Williams** remains unsigned despite extension eligibility, with talks stalled over valuation differences. More significantly, 2026 brings extension eligibility for potential superstars **Puka Nacua** (projected $24-30 million annually) and defensive tackle **Kobie Turner** (potentially $20-plus million). The Rams' newfound financial flexibility will be tested as they attempt to retain homegrown talent while maintaining roster depth.

## NFC West transforms into NFL's toughest division

The Rams' ambitious offseason comes as all three division rivals made significant improvements, creating what analysts predict will be the NFL's most competitive divisional race. The **49ers**, despite losing Deebo Samuel and signing Brock Purdy to a massive $265 million extension, remain formidable with their elite defense. The **Seahawks** acquired Cooper Kupp from the Rams and signed Sam Darnold to replace Geno Smith, betting on offensive reinvention. Most dramatically, the **Cardinals** loaded up defensively, adding Josh Sweat, Calais Campbell, and Dalvin Tomlinson to create a potentially elite unit.

ESPN's Football Power Index gives the Rams just a **34% chance** to repeat as division champions despite rating them as the division's best team, complicated by a first-place schedule featuring the Eagles, Ravens, and Lions. The margin for error has evaporated in a division where all four teams project as potential playoff contenders, making every divisional game crucial and health paramount.

## Conclusion

The Rams' 2025 offseason represents a masterclass in modern NFL team building, balancing immediate championship aspirations with long-term sustainability. By replacing sentiment with pragmatism—trading Kupp for Adams, accumulating future draft capital, and creating cap flexibility—Les Snead has positioned the franchise to extend its competitive window while preparing for inevitable transitions. The additions of proven veterans like Adams and Ford address immediate needs, while the draft focus on contributors over projects shows urgency around Stafford's closing championship window.

Success in 2025 will hinge on three factors: Stafford's health at age 37, the defensive improvements translating to consistent run defense, and navigating the gauntlet of an improved NFC West. The Rams have assembled the talent and maintained the coaching infrastructure to compete at the highest level. Whether they can overcome an aging core and brutal schedule to defend their division crown will determine if this strategic pivot launches a new era of sustained success or merely delays an inevitable rebuild.
