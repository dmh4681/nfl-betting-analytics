# Cleveland Browns execute strategic reset after Watson collapse

The Cleveland Browns' 2025 offseason represents a fundamental shift in organizational philosophy - a calculated "soft reset" that acknowledges the Deshaun Watson experiment has failed while laying groundwork for sustainable competitiveness. After finishing 3-14 in 2024, GM Andrew Berry orchestrated a comprehensive roster overhaul that balances immediate needs with long-term strategic positioning, all while navigating one of the NFL's most challenging salary cap situations.

The Browns entered the offseason with Watson facing a second Achilles surgery that will likely sideline him for all of 2025, forcing the franchise to completely reimagine its offensive identity. Rather than making desperate win-now moves, Cleveland executed a coherent strategy focused on accumulating draft capital, returning to proven systems, and building sustainable infrastructure for a 2026-2027 competitive window.

## The Myles Garrett resolution anchors defensive foundation

The Browns' most critical offseason accomplishment was ending Myles Garrett's trade request standoff with a **4-year, $160 million extension** that makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Garrett, who publicly requested a trade in February citing championship aspirations, ultimately agreed to remain Cleveland's defensive cornerstone through 2030. The deal includes **$123.5 million guaranteed** and a no-trade clause, demonstrating mutual commitment between the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year and an organization attempting to rebuild around him.

This extension proved essential for maintaining Jim Schwartz's league-leading defense, which allowed just 270.2 yards per game in 2024. The Browns subsequently added interior pass rusher **Maliek Collins** (2 years, $20 million) to replace departed Dalvin Tomlinson, providing the 3-technique presence that complements Garrett's edge dominance. Collins' 45 pressures with San Francisco in 2024 suggest immediate impact potential in Schwartz's aggressive scheme.

The defensive rebuild extended through the draft, where Cleveland selected Michigan DT **Mason Graham** with the 5th overall pick after a strategic trade-down. Graham's versatility across multiple techniques fits Schwartz's evolving approach - adding pre-snap deception and multiple fronts to the fastball foundation established in 2024. UCLA linebacker **Carson Schwesinger** (33rd overall) addresses the potential loss of Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, whose neck injury leaves his 2025 availability uncertain.

## Offensive philosophy returns to Stefanski's proven foundation

Cleveland's offensive overhaul began with dismissing coordinator Ken Dorsey after one season, during which the Browns ranked 32nd in scoring at 15.2 points per game. The promotion of 32-year-old **Tommy Rees** to offensive coordinator signals a return to Kevin Stefanski's West Coast/wide-zone system that produced 11-win seasons in 2020 and 2023. Critically, Stefanski will resume play-calling duties, abandoning the delegation experiment that contributed to offensive dysfunction.

The quarterback room underwent complete reconstruction through a multi-pronged approach. Cleveland traded for **Kenny Pickett** from Philadelphia, sending Dorian Thompson-Robinson and a 5th-round pick. They re-signed veteran **Joe Flacco** while drafting Oregon's **Dillon Gabriel** (94th overall) and, most surprisingly, Colorado's **Shedeur Sanders** in the 5th round - a selection ESPN's Mel Kiper called "the biggest steal of the draft" after ranking Sanders as his 5th overall prospect.

Free agency additions focused on offensive line depth and competition. Veteran tackle **Cornelius Lucas** (2 years, $10 million) provides insurance for Dawand Jones, who has ended consecutive seasons on injured reserve. Guard **Teven Jenkins** joined on a one-year deal, adding interior competition. These signings acknowledge the line's role in Cleveland's offensive collapse - they allowed pressure on 41.8% of dropbacks in 2024, contributing directly to Watson's season-ending injury.

## Financial constraints shape conservative free agency approach

Operating with just **$10.47 million in cap space** and carrying **$54.54 million in dead money** - one of the NFL's heaviest burdens - Berry executed a value-driven free agency strategy. Watson's **$35.97 million cap hit** despite his injury absence forced creative roster construction. The Browns' dead money includes **$22.58 million** from Amari Cooper's trade to Buffalo and **$14.23 million** from Za'Darius Smith's deal with Detroit.

Notable departures included safety Juan Thornhill (Steelers), defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson (Cardinals, 2 years/$29 million), and quarterback Jameis Winston (Giants). Each departure reflected calculated decisions about resource allocation - Thornhill never justified his contract after arriving from Kansas City, while Tomlinson's release created cap flexibility for younger talent.

The Browns' conservative spending preserved flexibility for potential in-season moves while acknowledging their competitive limitations. Most free agent signings came on one-year deals with minimal guarantees - Jerome Baker ($1.42 million), Deion Carter ($800K), Joe Tryon-Shoyinka ($4.75 million) - allowing roster turnover flexibility as younger players develop.

## Draft strategy prioritizes future over present

Cleveland's draft approach epitomized their long-term thinking. Holding the 2nd overall pick, the Browns traded down with Jacksonville, receiving the 5th pick, 36th pick, 126th pick, and crucially, **a 2026 first-round selection**. This trade, while passing on potential franchise-changers Travis Hunter or Abdul Carter, provides ammunition for a future quarterback pursuit when Watson's contract becomes slightly more manageable.

The draft haul addressed multiple needs while emphasizing youth development. Running backs **Quinshon Judkins** (Ohio State, 36th overall) and **Dylan Sampson** (Tennessee, 126th) provide a potential thunder-and-lightning combination to replace the unsigned Nick Chubb. Tight end **Harold Fannin Jr.** (Bowling Green, 67th) set FBS receiving records at his position and offers the versatile chess piece Stefanski's offense requires.

The selection of two quarterbacks - Gabriel and Sanders - acknowledges Watson's uncertain future while creating genuine competition. Sanders' availability at pick 144 represents either a massive draft oversight by other teams or concerns about his durability behind Colorado's porous offensive line. Regardless, Cleveland secured a polished passer with 14,327 career yards and proven leadership qualities.

## Organizational stability masks fundamental changes

While maintaining front office continuity - GM Andrew Berry and head coach Kevin Stefanski both retained despite the 3-14 disaster - Cleveland executed significant philosophical shifts. Owner Jimmy Haslam's declaration that 2025 represents "Year 1" for the current regime acknowledges previous false starts while committing to patient development.

The coaching staff changes focused exclusively on the offensive side of the ball. Beyond Dorsey's dismissal, Cleveland replaced offensive line coach Andy Dickerson with **Mike Bloomgren**, whose college experience brings fresh perspectives to a unit requiring fundamental reconstruction. The retention of defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz proved crucial for maintaining schematic continuity on Cleveland's strength.

One notable front office departure saw Dan Saganey, director of player personnel since 2009, join Tennessee in April. His exit removes significant institutional knowledge but also enables fresh evaluation perspectives as Cleveland rebuilds its roster construction philosophy.

## AFC North reality shapes competitive timeline

Cleveland's strategic approach acknowledges their diminished standing within the NFL's toughest division. The Ravens remain clear favorites with Lamar Jackson's sustained excellence and roster stability. Pittsburgh faces quarterback uncertainty with Russell Wilson's departure and Aaron Rodgers retirement rumors. Cincinnati confronts defensive coordinator turnover and Trey Hendrickson's contract dispute.

Rather than desperately chasing immediate competition with Baltimore's juggernaut, Cleveland positioned itself for the division's next competitive cycle. The accumulation of 2026 draft capital, development of young quarterbacks, and maintenance of defensive excellence creates a foundation for emerging when current division powers face their own transitional periods.

The Browns' 2025 over/under of 4.5 wins reflects realistic expectations for a transitional season. However, the coherent strategy - returning to proven offensive systems, maintaining defensive identity, and accumulating future assets - suggests organizational learning from previous boom-bust cycles.

## Conclusion

Cleveland's 2025 offseason represents organizational maturity previously absent from Haslam's ownership tenure. By acknowledging the Watson acquisition's failure without completely abandoning competitive infrastructure, Berry and Stefanski demonstrated strategic patience that prioritizes sustainable success over desperate short-term fixes. The Garrett extension anchors the defense, the draft provides future flexibility, and the return to Stefanski's offensive system offers proven framework for development.

Success ultimately depends on either Gabriel or Sanders emerging as a franchise quarterback and whether Schwartz's defense can maintain excellence through another offensive transition. The Browns won't compete for the AFC North in 2025, but they've positioned themselves to emerge stronger when Watson's contract albatross finally expires. In a division where sustained excellence requires both patience and strategic vision, Cleveland's 2025 offseason suggests they've finally learned those lessons.
