# Ravens reshape roster with strategic signings and elite draft haul for 2025

The Baltimore Ravens executed a calculated offseason strategy under GM Eric DeCosta, addressing key needs while navigating tight cap constraints to strengthen their championship window around MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson. Despite losing several defensive contributors, Baltimore landed elite draft value and made targeted veteran additions that position them as AFC North favorites for a third consecutive year.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

The Ravens operated with limited cap space but made strategic veteran additions to address specific roster needs. **DeAndre Hopkins headlined the external signings with a 1-year, $5 million deal** after managing just 610 receiving yards with Tennessee in 2024. The 32-year-old wideout provides reliable hands (1.5% drop rate) and red zone presence as the No. 3 receiver behind Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman, finally giving Jackson a proven veteran target after recent failures with Odell Beckham Jr. and Diontae Johnson.

Defensively, **cornerback Chidobe Awuzie signed a 1-year contract** to fill the void left by Brandon Stephens' departure. The 29-year-old brings 81 career starts over eight seasons and projects as the immediate No. 3 corner behind Marlon Humphrey and 2024 first-rounder Nate Wiggins. With Baltimore entering camp with only two corners possessing 200+ career defensive snaps, Awuzie's experience becomes critical for secondary depth.

The most significant depth signing came at backup quarterback, where **Cooper Rush inked a 2-year, $6.2 million base deal** (up to $12.2M with incentives, $4.2M guaranteed). Rush's 9-5 career record as a starter and proven ability to manage games represents a major upgrade from Josh Johnson, providing essential insurance for Jackson given the Ravens' championship aspirations.

Special teams specialist **Jake Hummel joined on a 1-year deal** from the Rams, where he recorded eight special teams tackles and blocked a punt for a touchdown against Buffalo. His addition helps offset the departures of Malik Harrison and Chris Board, who combined for 718 special teams snaps in 2024.

The Ravens also invested heavily in undrafted free agents, with linebacker Jay Higgins (Iowa) leading the class with a $20,000 signing bonus after recording 295 tackles over his final two college seasons. Baltimore native Jahmal Banks (Nebraska) and cornerback Keondre Jackson (Illinois State) headline additional UDFA signings aimed at developing depth through the organization's proven track record with undrafted talent.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

Baltimore's free agency losses created specific roster holes despite being fewer in number than their 14 departures in 2024. **Patrick Mekari's move to Jacksonville on a 3-year, $37.5 million deal** ($22.5M guaranteed) represents the most significant loss from a versatility standpoint. The 27-year-old started all 17 games in 2024 (14 at left guard, 3 at right tackle) and had experience at all five offensive line positions throughout his Ravens career. His departure eliminates Baltimore's most reliable swing lineman and forces Andrew Vorhees into the starting left guard role.

**Brandon Stephens signed with the New York Jets for 3 years, $36 million** ($22.98M guaranteed) after a disappointing 2024 campaign where he allowed the second-most receiving yards in the NFL (806) and tied for the most completions allowed of 20+ air yards. Despite his regression from an excellent 2023 season, his durability (missed just 3 games in 4 years) and starting experience create a void the Ravens hope Nate Wiggins can fill.

The most painful departure came when **linebacker Malik Harrison joined division rival Pittsburgh on a 2-year, $10 million deal**. Harrison set career highs with 54 tackles and 2 sacks while playing 38% of defensive snaps and contributing 336 special teams snaps. His move to the Steelers marks the second consecutive year Pittsburgh poached a Ravens linebacker after signing Patrick Queen in 2024.

**Chris Board's departure to the Giants** (2 years, up to $6M) compounds the special teams losses. Board led the team with 382 special teams snaps (80% of available) and served as special teams captain for the playoffs. Combined with Harrison, the Ravens lost their two most important special teams contributors who accounted for 718 combined special teams snaps.

Offensive lineman Josh Jones signed a 1-year deal worth up to $4.75 million with Seattle after playing primarily in jumbo packages. While a lesser loss, his departure further depletes offensive line depth alongside Mekari's exit.

The silver lining: Baltimore projects to receive three compensatory picks in 2026 (two 5th-rounders for Stephens and Mekari, one 7th for Jones), maintaining their reputation as masters of the compensatory formula.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

The Ravens executed minimal trade activity during the 2025 offseason, with their draft-day maneuvering representing the primary transactions. **Baltimore made two draft-day trades to maximize value**, first dealing picks #136 (4th round) and #183 (6th round) to Tennessee for picks #141 (5th round) and #178 (6th round). DeCosta called this "an analytics thing" based on their draft board evaluation.

The second trade sent pick #176 (6th round) and a 2026 6th-rounder to the Jets for pick #186 (6th round) and a 2026 5th-rounder, effectively moving down 10 spots while upgrading future draft capital.

The shadow hanging over the offseason was October's failed **Diontae Johnson trade with Carolina**, where Baltimore sent a 2025 5th-round pick (#163 overall) and received Johnson plus a 6th-rounder (#183, later traded to Tennessee). Johnson's December release after causing locker room disruption meant the Ravens essentially traded down from the 5th to 6th round for nothing, representing a rare misfire in DeCosta's typically shrewd dealings.

No significant player-for-player trades materialized during the offseason as Baltimore focused on the draft and targeted free agency to reshape their roster. The lack of major trade activity reflects both the Ravens' tight cap situation and their confidence in addressing needs through their league-leading 11 draft picks.

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

Baltimore's draft haul earned widespread acclaim as the AFC North's best class, with DeCosta securing elite value despite picking 27th overall. **The Ravens landed Georgia safety Malaki Starks with the 27th pick**, a player DeCosta called "the best safety in the draft" who many projected as a top-15 selection. Starks brings elite ball skills and versatility, posting an 85.6 run-defense grade while starting 42 games at Georgia. He projects as an immediate starter alongside Kyle Hamilton, giving defensive coordinator Zach Orr tremendous flexibility in the secondary.

The draft's biggest steal came at pick #59 when **Marshall edge rusher Mike Green fell to the second round** despite leading FBS with 17 sacks and ranking 18th on Mel Kiper Jr.'s board. Green's 92.4 PFF grade and 20.2% pass-rush win rate address Baltimore's 4th-worst ranking in team pass-rush win rate (33%). With Kyle Van Noy entering his age-34 season and Odafe Oweh in a contract year, Green provides immediate rotational help with star potential.

**LSU offensive tackle Emery Jones Jr. (3rd round, #91)** offers swing tackle ability and potential left guard competition after playing exclusively right tackle in college (2,323 of 2,355 career snaps). California linebacker **Teddye Buchanan (#129)** brings elite athleticism with a 40-inch vertical jump to replace departed special teams aces Harrison and Board.

The middle rounds focused on developmental talent, with Alabama A&M tackle **Carson Vinson (#141)** offering an 84 3/8" wingspan and Western Michigan corner **Bilhal Kone (#178)** providing slot coverage depth. The Ravens made franchise history by selecting kicker **Tyler Loop (#186)** from Arizona, their first-ever drafted kicker, signaling potential succession planning for Justin Tucker.

Late-round selections included Colorado returner **LaJohntay Wester (#203)**, who caught passes in 50 consecutive games and brings elite return ability, Virginia Tech defensive lineman **Aeneas Peebles (#210)** with a 91.2 PFF pass-rush grade, and Rutgers corner **Robert Longerbeam (#212)** who ran a 4.39 forty despite being undersized. LSU guard **Garrett Dellinger (#243)** rounded out the class as the fourth LSU offensive lineman drafted in 2025.

The draft philosophy reflected DeCosta's "best player available" approach, with Baltimore using six picks on defense after employing their first two selections on that side of the ball for the first time since 2017. The focus on playmakers while division rivals loaded up on run-stoppers suggests different strategic approaches to winning the AFC North.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

Baltimore's most critical offseason move came via internal retention when **left tackle Ronnie Stanley signed a 3-year, $60 million extension** after testing the market. The deal keeps Jackson's blindside protector in Baltimore through 2027 after Stanley allowed just 3.39 seconds average time to pressure (4th-best among left tackles). Ravens brass identified Stanley as their top free agency priority and succeeded in preventing him from reaching the open market.

The shocking extension belonged to **Derrick Henry, who inked a 2-year, $30 million deal** with $25 million guaranteed after his spectacular 2024 campaign (1,921 rushing yards, 18 touchdowns). The extension keeps the 31-year-old future Hall of Famer in purple through his age-33 season and maintains the NFL's most devastating rushing attack alongside Jackson.

**Patrick Ricard returned on a 1-year, fully guaranteed deal** worth $2.87 million, ensuring the 5-time Pro Bowl fullback continues leading the way for Henry. His retention proved critical given Baltimore's commitment to their record-setting ground game that averaged 182.2 rushing yards per game in 2024.

Additional depth signings included wide receiver **Tylan Wallace** (1-year deal) returning as the fourth or fifth receiver and special teams contributor after his 76-yard punt return touchdown in 2023, and guard **Ben Cleveland** providing interior line depth behind Daniel Faalele and Andrew Vorhees.

The Ravens also secured their offensive coaching staff with **coordinator Todd Monken signing a multi-year extension** despite head coaching interest from multiple teams. Monken oversaw the NFL's best offense in 2024, and his retention ensures continuity for Jackson and the league's most explosive attack.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

Baltimore's most significant coaching addition came when **Chuck Pagano emerged from a 4-year retirement to serve as Senior Secondary Coach**, addressing the Ravens' 26th-ranked pass defense that allowed 237.4 yards per game. The former Colts head coach (2012-17) brings veteran leadership to complement second-year defensive coordinator Zach Orr, with his specific focus on improving a secondary that struggled despite elite personnel.

The linebacker room received new leadership with **Tyler Santucci's hiring as linebackers coach**, replacing departed Mark DeLeone. Santucci brings college defensive coordinator experience from Georgia Tech and Duke, tasked with developing Roquan Smith and Trenton Simpson while integrating draft picks Teddye Buchanan and UDFA Jay Higgins.

**Donald D'Alesio joined from Kansas City as defensive backs coach**, bringing championship pedigree from the Chiefs' back-to-back Super Bowl wins. His hiring reflects Baltimore's commitment to fixing their pass defense through proven coaching after ranking among the league's worst in explosive plays allowed.

Former Ravens safety **Anthony Levine Sr. returned as assistant special teams coach**, leveraging his playing experience (2012-2021) to help coordinator Chris Horton replace the production of departed special teams aces Harrison and Board.

Head coach **John Harbaugh secured a 3-year extension through 2028**, providing organizational stability as the Ravens pursue their third championship. The extension reinforces ownership's commitment despite Baltimore's 78 regular-season wins since 2018 without a Super Bowl appearance, the most in NFL history over that span.

Dean Pees continues serving as defensive consultant, maintaining his influence on Baltimore's defensive philosophy while allowing Orr to grow into the coordinator role. The blend of veteran guidance (Pagano, Pees) with younger leadership (Orr, Santucci) reflects a calculated approach to defensive improvement.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

The Ravens enter 2025 with **$16.33 million in cap space, ranking 7th-lowest in the NFL** and tightest among AFC North teams. Jackson's $43.5 million cap hit leads the team, followed by Marlon Humphrey ($23.7M), Stanley ($16.9M), Mark Andrews ($16.5M), and Henry ($13.3M). With $18.6 million in dead money and Jackson's cap number ballooning to $74.5 million in 2026, Baltimore faces increasing financial pressure to maximize their current championship window.

DeCosta's "right player, right price" philosophy guided a calculated offseason that prioritized internal retention over external splashes. The strategic use of the compensatory pick system netted three projected 2026 selections while maintaining roster quality, exemplifying Baltimore's organizational patience despite championship urgency.

**Major needs successfully addressed include offensive line stability** through Stanley's extension and Noteboom's addition, veteran receiver help via Hopkins, and coaching experience to fix the pass defense with Pagano's hire. The draft added immediate contributors at safety (Starks) and edge rusher (Green) while building depth across the roster.

**Critical needs remaining unaddressed center on safety depth** following Ar'Darius Washington's Achilles injury and pass rush depth beyond Oweh and the aging Van Noy. The secondary's health becomes paramount given 2024's struggles, while the defensive line lost Michael Pierce to retirement without a clear replacement at nose tackle.

Eric DeCosta's team-building philosophy emphasized maintaining the championship core while adding complementary pieces within financial constraints. The focus on one-year veteran deals (Hopkins, Awuzie) preserves future flexibility while the draft's emphasis on defensive playmakers addresses the roster's primary weakness.

The AFC North competitive landscape finds Baltimore as division favorites but facing renewed challenges. Pittsburgh's pursuit of Aaron Rodgers and theft of Harrison continues their linebacker poaching, Cincinnati invested heavily in retaining receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, while Cleveland added multiple quarterback options through the draft. All three rivals focused on run-stopping personnel, potentially to counter Baltimore's dominant ground game.

**The Ravens' championship window spans 2025-2027** with Jackson entering his prime at age 28, though urgency intensifies given his career -12 playoff turnover margin across five losses. Baltimore tied as AFC favorites (+360) and Super Bowl favorites (+700) but faces nine games against 2024 playoff teams, including brutal early tests at Buffalo (Week 1) and Kansas City (Week 4).

The 2025 offseason reflected measured aggression within constraints, as DeCosta maintained the NFL's most complete roster while addressing specific weaknesses. Whether Chuck Pagano can fix the pass defense and Jackson can overcome playoff demons will determine if Baltimore finally breaks through after years of regular season dominance. The pieces are in place, but the championship clock continues ticking on one of the NFL's most talented rosters.
