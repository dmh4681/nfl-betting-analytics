# Buffalo Bills 2025 offseason built on defensive transformation to finally conquer Kansas City

The Buffalo Bills entered the 2025 offseason with a singular focus: addressing the defensive deficiencies that allowed Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs to score 32 points in yet another AFC Championship Game heartbreak. Rather than pursuing blockbuster acquisitions, General Manager Brandon Beane executed a methodical plan centered on defensive reconstruction through the draft, strategic veteran additions, and crucial contract extensions that locked up the team's young core through the end of the decade.

With Josh Allen securing a record-breaking 6-year, $330 million extension featuring **$250 million guaranteed** (the highest in NFL history), Buffalo provided the financial foundation to maintain their championship window while addressing their most glaring weakness. The Bills used their first five draft picks on defense, signed calculated risk Joey Bosa to replace the released Von Miller, and retained offensive coordinator Joe Brady after his system helped Buffalo lead the league in total scoring. This comprehensive approach reflects a team confident in its offensive identity but determined to solve the defensive equation that has prevented them from reaching their first Super Bowl since 1994.

## Free agency featured targeted additions and painful departures

Buffalo's free agency period was defined by financial constraints and strategic decisions. The Bills entered the offseason **$9.7 million over the salary cap**, forcing difficult choices on aging veterans while prioritizing younger talent retention.

The marquee signing was **Joey Bosa**, the five-time Pro Bowl defensive end who agreed to a 1-year, $12.6 million deal after spending his first nine seasons with the Chargers. Despite missing 23 games over the past three seasons with various injuries, Bosa represents a calculated gamble to replace Von Miller's pass rush production at half the cost. His contract structure includes $9 million as a signing bonus with four void years, keeping the 2025 cap hit at just $5.32 million.

Buffalo also added wide receiver **Josh Palmer** on a 3-year, $36 million contract from the Chargers, bringing a downfield threat to complement Khalil Shakir in the slot. The Canadian native from Brampton, Ontario caught 39 passes for 584 yards in seven starts during 2024. Defensive additions included **Michael Hoecht** (2-year, $24 million) and **Larry Ogunjobi** (1-year deal), though both face six-game suspensions to start 2025 for PED violations.

The most painful departure was **Von Miller**, released to save $8.4 million despite $15.4 million in dead money. The 36-year-old's production had declined to just six sacks in 2024, making his $23.8 million cap hit untenable. Perhaps more surprisingly, **Amari Cooper** remains unsigned after the Bills acquired him via trade from Cleveland in October 2024. Despite Buffalo's reported interest, cap constraints likely prevented re-signing the veteran receiver who played through a wrist injury and managed just 32 catches for 297 yards in eight games.

Other losses included **Mack Hollins** signing with division rival New England, while the Bills traded former first-round pick **Kaiir Elam** to Dallas for a 2025 fifth-round pick and 2026 seventh-rounder after he failed to develop as expected.

## Defense dominated draft strategy with speed and pass rush priorities

The Bills made history by selecting defensive players with their first five picks for the first time since 2006, directly addressing the unit that allowed Kansas City to score its season-high point total in the AFC Championship Game.

With the 30th overall pick, Buffalo selected **Maxwell Hairston**, the Kentucky cornerback who ran the fastest 40-yard dash at the combine (4.28 seconds). The West Bloomfield, Michigan native brings elite speed to a secondary that struggled covering Kansas City's receivers. Though concerns exist about his 183-pound frame, "Mad Max" is expected to compete immediately for a starting role opposite Christian Benford.

Buffalo traded up to 41st overall to select South Carolina defensive tackle **T.J. Sanders**, who recorded 4.0 sacks in 2024 and 9.5 for his career. The versatile interior pass rusher addresses a critical need and projects as a three-down player who can complement Ed Oliver. The Bills continued their defensive investment with Arkansas edge rusher **Landon Jackson** (72nd overall), who brings 16 career sacks and impressive length at 6'6".

Fourth-round pick **Deone Walker** from Kentucky reunites with teammate Hairston, adding a massive body for interior run defense. The Bills also selected Ohio State defensive back **Jordan Hancock** with the fifth-round pick acquired in the Elam trade, adding versatility with experience at corner, slot, and safety.

Buffalo didn't address offense until the sixth round, selecting tight end **Jackson Hawes** from Georgia Tech (173rd overall) and offensive tackle **Chase Lundt** from UConn (206th). The draft concluded with Maryland wide receiver **Kaden Prather**, a 6'4" target who recorded 500-plus receiving yards in each of his last three collegiate seasons.

## Contract extensions locked up emerging stars through decade's end

The Bills' most significant offseason accomplishment may be securing their young core with team-friendly extensions that provide both immediate cap relief and long-term stability.

Josh Allen's extension through 2030 not only set guaranteed money records but cleverly reduced his 2025 cap hit by approximately $3 million while maintaining flexibility for future restructures. The deal's structure, with $147 million fully guaranteed at signing and escalating guarantees through 2029, demonstrates mutual commitment while preserving the team's ability to build around their franchise quarterback.

Wide receiver **Khalil Shakir** received a 4-year, $53 million extension that ESPN called Buffalo's "best move" of the offseason. After leading the team with 76 receptions for 821 yards in 2024, Shakir's deal carries just a $2.6 million cap hit in 2025 despite the substantial commitment. Similarly structured extensions for **Greg Rousseau** (4-year, $80 million), **Terrel Bernard** (4-year, $50 million), and **Christian Benford** (4-year, $76 million) locked up three defensive cornerstones while maintaining immediate cap flexibility.

The Bills also retained key role players including safety **Damar Hamlin**, who started 14 games in 2024 after his remarkable recovery, and third-down specialist **Ty Johnson**, whom Allen praised as the team's "best third-down back." Long snapper **Reid Ferguson** received a four-year extension, maintaining special teams continuity for the longest-tenured Bill.

## Coaching continuity continues except for special teams overhaul

Sean McDermott returns for his ninth season as head coach, maintaining organizational stability despite the AFC Championship Game disappointment. The retention of offensive coordinator **Joe Brady** proved crucial after he drew interest from multiple head coaching vacancies, including the Saints job he withdrew from to remain in Buffalo. Brady's system helped the Bills lead the league in total scoring (including playoffs) in 2024, validating the mid-2023 decision to promote him after firing Ken Dorsey.

Defensive coordinator **Bobby Babich** enters his second full season after replacing Leslie Frazier. The former linebackers coach has earned locker room respect and was instrumental in developing Terrel Bernard's breakout 2024 campaign.

The lone significant coaching change came at special teams coordinator, where **Chris Tabor** replaces Matthew Smiley. McDermott's swift reversal on Smiley—initially indicating he would return before firing him immediately after the AFC Championship loss—underscores the urgency to address Buffalo's special teams struggles. Tabor brings extensive experience from Cleveland, Chicago, and Carolina, having been rated the second-best special teams coordinator by the NFLPA in 2022.

## Strategic approach targets specific weaknesses rather than dramatic overhaul

Buffalo's 2025 offseason reflects organizational maturity and strategic focus. Facing approximately **$15.7 million in negative cap space** entering free agency, Brandon Beane acknowledged the Bills wouldn't be "big spenders," instead pursuing "incremental improvements" over "big splashes."

The defensive transformation directly addresses Kansas City's offensive success. Buffalo ranked 24th in pass defense (226.1 yards per game) and was the worst among AFC playoff teams in total yards allowed. The philosophical shift toward more man-to-man coverage, enabled by Hairston's speed and Benford's development, moves away from the zone-heavy schemes Kansas City repeatedly exploited.

Despite the measured approach, significant questions remain. Running back **James Cook's** public contract demands for $15 million annually created potential locker room drama. Joey Bosa's calf injury during OTAs highlighted ongoing durability concerns. The secondary depth behind Benford and Hairston remains uncertain, as does whether the defensive improvements will prove sufficient against Kansas City's explosive offense.

## Conclusion

The Buffalo Bills' 2025 offseason represents evolution rather than revolution, with targeted improvements addressing specific weaknesses while maintaining their successful foundation. The heavy defensive investment—both in draft capital and free agent spending—directly targets their Kansas City problem through enhanced speed, pass rush, and coverage depth.

By locking up their young core through the decade while making calculated veteran additions, Buffalo has positioned itself for sustained excellence. The Bills enter 2025 as the only team favored in all 17 regular season games, reflecting both their consistent dominance and the weight of expectations. Whether these incremental improvements prove sufficient to finally overcome their playoff nemesis will determine if this methodical approach delivers Buffalo's first Super Bowl appearance in over three decades.
