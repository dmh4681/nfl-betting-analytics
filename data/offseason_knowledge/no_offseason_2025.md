# Saints navigate tumultuous offseason with coaching overhaul and quarterback transition

The New Orleans Saints' 2025 offseason marked a dramatic turning point for the franchise, featuring a complete coaching staff overhaul, the unexpected retirement of Derek Carr, and aggressive salary cap maneuvering to navigate the NFL's worst cap situation. After finishing 5-12 and firing Dennis Allen midseason, the Saints hired Kellen Moore as head coach and embarked on what GM Mickey Loomis calls a "retooling" rather than a rebuild. The offseason's most shocking development came when Carr retired in May due to a degenerative shoulder injury, accelerating the team's quarterback transition and providing unexpected cap relief.

## 1. Free Agency Signings (External acquisitions)

The Saints' free agency approach balanced targeted impact signings with depth additions, constrained by their severe cap limitations but aided by strategic restructures.

**Justin Reid** emerged as the marquee external signing, joining on a **3-year, $31.5 million deal** ($22.25 million guaranteed) after five successful seasons in Kansas City. The versatile safety immediately fills the void left by Will Harris's departure and brings championship experience to a young secondary. His $10.5 million average annual value represents significant investment in defensive leadership.

**Brandin Cooks** returned to New Orleans on a **2-year contract**, reuniting with the team that drafted him in 2014. The veteran receiver adds proven production and route-running expertise to complement Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed. At 31, Cooks provides the veteran presence Moore's new offense requires while mentoring younger receivers.

**Isaac Yiadom** also returned on a **3-year deal** after spending 2024 with San Francisco. The cornerback previously excelled for the Saints in 2022-23, recording 14 pass breakups and an interception during the second half of 2023. His familiarity with the system proved valuable as the team rebuilt its decimated cornerback room.

The Saints filled out their roster with strategic one-year signings including **Chris Rumph II** (DE), **Jack Stoll** (TE), **Will Clapp** (C/G), **Jonah Williams** (DE), **Landon Young** (OT), **Ugo Amadi** (DB), and **Dillon Radunz** (OL). These depth pieces provide competition and special teams value while maintaining cap flexibility.

## 2. Free Agency Losses (Key departures)

The Saints' secondary suffered significant losses through free agency departures, compounding the earlier Marshon Lattimore trade.

**Paulson Adebo** signed with the New York Giants, leaving a substantial hole at cornerback. The young corner had shown promise as a starter opposite Lattimore, making his departure particularly damaging to an already thin position group. **Will Harris** joined Washington on a **2-year, $8 million deal**, prompting the Saints' pursuit of Justin Reid as his replacement.

**Payton Turner**, the disappointing 2021 first-round pick, signed a one-year prove-it deal with Dallas after battling injuries throughout his Saints tenure. The team also released **Jamaal Williams** to save $1.59 million in cap space, ending the veteran running back's brief stint in New Orleans.

The Saints made a strong push to sign **Charvarius Ward** but lost out to Indianapolis, who offered a **3-year, $54 million contract**. This failed pursuit highlighted the team's ongoing cornerback crisis.

## 3. Trades (In and out)

The **Marshon Lattimore trade** to Washington represented the most significant move, completed November 5, 2024. The Saints sent their four-time Pro Bowl cornerback and a 2025 fifth-round pick (147th overall) to the Commanders in exchange for **third (93rd), fourth (131st), and sixth-round (184th) picks** in the 2025 draft. While creating **$31.7 million in dead money**, the trade provided crucial draft capital for the rebuilding effort.

A minor August 2024 trade saw the Saints acquire **DT John Ridgeway III** and a 2025 seventh-round pick (248th) from Washington in exchange for a 2025 sixth-rounder, providing defensive line depth while maintaining draft assets.

## 4. 2025 NFL Draft (All picks and analysis)

The Saints maximized their nine selections, the most since 2015, following their "inside-out" building philosophy by selecting linemen with four of their first five picks.

**Round 1, Pick 9: Kelvin Banks Jr., OT, Texas** - The unanimous All-American and Outland Trophy winner immediately addresses the offensive line crisis. At 6'5", 315 pounds, Banks started all 42 games at left tackle for Texas and projects as an immediate starter with positional versatility.

**Round 2, Pick 40: Tyler Shough, QB, Louisville** - The 6'6" signal-caller's selection proved prescient given Carr's subsequent retirement. Despite being 25 (oldest player drafted), Shough's experience at Oregon, Texas Tech, and Louisville (3,569 yards, 28 TDs in 2024) positions him as the likely Week 1 starter.

**Round 3, Pick 71: Vernon Broughton, DT, Texas** - The 6'5", 290-pound interior lineman adds athleticism to the defensive line rotation alongside Bryan Bresee.

**Round 3, Pick 93: Jonas Sanker, S, Virginia** - Acquired via the Lattimore trade, the 6'2" team captain addresses the Saints' 29th-ranked run defense with physicality and communication skills.

**Round 4, Pick 112: Danny Stutsman, LB, Oklahoma** - The consensus All-American and Butkus Award finalist (109 tackles in 2024) represents the future at linebacker with 376 career tackles.

**Round 4, Pick 131: Quincy Riley, CB, Louisville** - Another Lattimore trade acquisition, Riley's 15 career interceptions and sub-50% completion rate allowed provide immediate cornerback depth.

**Round 6, Pick 184: Devin Neal, RB, Kansas** - The productive back (3,636 yards, 41 TDs over three seasons) offers a pathway to the RB2 role behind Alvin Kamara.

**Round 7: Moliki Matavao, TE, UCLA** (248th) and **Fadil Diggs, DL, Syracuse** (254th) add developmental depth.

The Saints also signed 11 undrafted free agents, including Alabama punter **James Burnip**, the nation's top punting prospect.

## 5. Key Re-signings/Extensions (Internal retention)

**Chase Young's** **3-year, $51 million extension** (up to $57 million) headlines the Saints' retention efforts. Coming off a career-high 5.5 sacks and 66 QB pressures (7th among edge defenders), Young provides pass-rush continuity at approximately $17-19 million annually.

**Juwan Johnson** secured a **3-year, $30 million extension** ($10 million APY) with no third-year guarantees, providing the Saints flexibility in 2027 while retaining their top tight end.

The Saints also extended **Dante Pettis** (WR), **Nathan Shepherd** (DT), and applied the ERFA tender to **Nephi Sewell** (LB). **Tyrann Mathieu** and **Cedrick Wilson Jr.** both agreed to restructured contracts to remain in New Orleans.

## 6. Coaching/Front Office Changes (Leadership transitions)

The Saints underwent their most significant coaching overhaul in years after **firing Dennis Allen** on November 4, 2024, following a 2-7 start. Allen finished 18-25 over two-plus seasons before joining Chicago as defensive coordinator.

**Kellen Moore** was hired February 11, 2025, as the 19th head coach in franchise history, fresh off coordinating Philadelphia's Super Bowl LIX championship offense. The 36-year-old brought an entirely new staff:

- **Offensive Coordinator:** Doug Nussmeier (former Eagles QB coach, ex-Saint 1994-97)
- **Defensive Coordinator:** Brandon Staley (former Chargers HC, 49ers assistant HC in 2024)
- **Special Teams Coordinator:** Phil Galiano (promoted internally)

Moore's staff includes several Saints connections, including OL coach Brendan Nugent (returning after 2015-21 stint) and associate head coach Joel Thomas. The hiring of Ted Rath as Director of Sports Performance from Philadelphia signals a modernization of the strength program.

**Mickey Loomis remains** as Executive VP/General Manager, entering his 22nd season in the role. The front office structure stayed intact despite the on-field struggles.

## 7. Context (Salary cap, injuries, needs addressed/unaddressed)

### Salary cap mastery amid crisis

The Saints entered 2025 approximately **$54 million over the cap**, the NFL's worst position. Through aggressive restructuring, they created over **$60 million in space**:

- **Derek Carr**: Initial restructure saved $30.9 million before his retirement
- **Erik McCoy**: $7.1 million savings
- **Cesar Ruiz**: $6.4 million savings
- **Carl Granderson**: $5.2 million savings
- **Combined restructures**: Created approximately $50 million in space

**Carr's retirement** provided unexpected relief when he forfeited $30 million of his 2025 salary while keeping his $10 million roster bonus. The Saints carry **$52.6 million in dead money** (18.8% of cap) but project **$37 million in 2026 cap space**, their healthiest outlook in years.

### Major injuries and roster impacts

**Derek Carr's** torn labrum and degenerative rotator cuff changes forced his May retirement, accelerating the quarterback transition. **Ryan Ramczyk's** knee issues point toward a post-June 1 retirement, creating additional dead money but roster flexibility.

### Needs addressed vs. unaddressed

**Successfully addressed:**
- **Quarterback**: Tyler Shough's selection proved fortuitous after Carr's retirement
- **Offensive line**: Kelvin Banks Jr. provides immediate help
- **Safety**: Justin Reid replaces Will Harris
- **Pass rush**: Chase Young extension maintains continuity

**Remaining concerns:**
- **Cornerback**: Despite adding Yiadom and drafting Riley, losing Lattimore and Adebo leaves the position dangerously thin
- **Wide receiver depth**: Relying heavily on Olave's health after concussion issues
- **Offensive line depth**: Still questions beyond Banks addition
- **Long-term quarterback**: Shough represents a bridge more than a long-term solution

The Saints' 2025 offseason reflects an organization in transition, balancing competitive aspirations with financial reality. Moore's hiring and Carr's unexpected retirement accelerated a youth movement that GM Loomis still refuses to call a rebuild. With no primetime games scheduled for the first time since 2000, the Saints face a challenging path back to relevance while finally achieving the cap flexibility that has eluded them for years.
